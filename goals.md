Just now realized that you can embed Beeminder graphs.

When I want to do more of something, like minutes of exercise, I enter the data for each day and the graph goes up. If I don't enter data (because I didn't exercise or because I forgot to enter it) the graph stays horizontal. I basically want to follow the yellow line.

I can edit the slope (steepness) of my goal path to increase or decrease the difficulty, usually with a week of buffer time before any changes go into effect.

If I go horizontal for too long then I crash into the yellow line, which is called derailment. When I derail, Beeminder charges my credit card a certain amount of money, usually starting at $5 and increasing the worse I get. A kind of motivation.

Click on each graph to see the detailed page with all the manually- or automatically-entered data. The checkmarks mean I'm in the clear. If there are numbers beneath the graph then I'm probably in trouble.
