    <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> So if you want to be an expert in practice rather than in name only, take a page from Steve McQueen's book. Don't be the guy telling everyone what to do. Be the guy asking all the questions. <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i>

  <p>
    <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> Being an expert isn't telling other people what you know. It's understanding what questions to ask, and flexibly applying your knowledge to the specific situation at hand. Being an expert means providing sensible, highly contextual direction. <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i>

## Teachable Moments

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> You should stretch your team, but not overburden them. You should usually talk to them about the way they are being stretched. If they buy in to it, they will be well motivated. On each project, or every other project, try to stretch them in both a way that they suggest and a way that you think will be good for them.<br><mark>Stretch them not by giving them more work, but by giving them a new skill or better yet a new role to play on the team.</mark> <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i>

## Building a Team

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> Your team is the product that you’re actually building. Instead of the software that you’re building, the product you’re building is a great team. Obviously what gets created by a great team is a great product. <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> Non-technical people who deal with developers on a regular basis almost universally hold the opinion that we are prima donnas at best and crybabies at worst. Don’t reinforce this stereotype with anger and impatience. <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i>
