    <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> But all we really need is the opportunity to see that it’s not hopeless. It’s not about what we already know, it’s about how we learn. <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i>

  <p>
    <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> Keep your sanity by ignoring the hype surrounding new tools. Keep your momentum by working through your chosen curriculum seven days a week, even if it's only for half an hour at a time. Keep your confidence by trusting the judgement you made with today's decisions. And remember: <mark>with patience, any able-minded person can become a great coder, and that includes you.</mark> <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> Don’t code alone in the dark. Talk about your code, write about your code. Share it, ask your peers to look at it, to discuss it, to criticize it. Get everyone involved in the process. <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i>

  <p>
    <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> Suddenly, I was an expert. I could speak the language. I knew what had to be done, and where things needed to go. After just two weeks of going through random tutorials, people were already beginning to see me as more competent than them. <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i>
