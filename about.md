<p>I'm Shelby. Take a look at my [portfolio site]({{ site.portfolio_url }}).</p>
<p>This site is my blog, built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). No ads, no profit, just some words thrown out into the abyss we call The Internet.</p>
<p>I write decently. I code poorly. I write about code exhaustively.</p>

<aside name="inspiration" style="top: 180px;"><p>My layout was inspired in part by <a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/architecture-performance-and-games.html">this beautiful book</a>.</p></aside>
