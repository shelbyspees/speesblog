| <img class="textWrapLeft" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/shelby.jpg" alt="What's up"/> | <br>I'm Shelby. Take a look at my [landing page](http://shelbyspees.github.io). <br><br>This site is my blog, built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). No ads, no profit, just some words thrown out into the abyss we call The Internet.<br><br>I write decently. I code poorly. I write about code exhaustively. |

My layout was inspired in part by [this beautiful book](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/architecture-performance-and-games.html). Still working out some of the details of implementing asides and the like. School comes first (I tell myself).
