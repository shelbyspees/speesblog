    Solid breakdown of the research that shows how our brains handle impulsiveness, and why it's not always a bad thing. I definitely recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Willpower-Instinct-Self-Control-Matters/dp/B006TI7MNA/ref=tmm_aud_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1426227731&sr=1-1">audiobook</a>, and at ~$6 it's a steal. Book review coming eventually.

    I like Dale Carnegie because his writing smacks you upside the head and asks, "Why aren't you doing this, dummy?!" None of it is outside the scope of common sense, but really how common is it anyway?

    While the premise that women aren't trying hard enough to break the glass ceiling is problematic, Sandberg makes a great point about men leaning in to the home. We want balance in all aspects of our lives.

    I liked this book because it discussed how promoting workplace equality for women depends on promoting domestic equality for men. Flex time for everyone and universal parental leave are some possible solutions.
