Last week when I was feeling really down, I met this amazingly hot guy. 

We totally clicked and I had to friend-zone him a little so I wouldn't be too intimidated to have a normal conversation with him. He's smart and muscley and he doesn't have an accent but he has this amazing flavor when he talks and I really hope I get to see him again. He's a bartender.

I started thinking about how I could do decently well as a bartender if I wanted to get into cocktails. And that transitioned into thinking about the sorts of hospitality jobs I'd be good at. 

I mean, I'm a pretty awesome server. I'm great with customers. I get positive feedback during nearly every shift. I've been doing this for less than six months.

Imagine if I were a flight attendant. I could use my language abilities! Or if I were a hotel concierge, or an airport lounge receptionist. Like for the first-class lounges. I'd be so good at that.

And then I think, what a waste! My brain needs puzzles to solve. Chatting in random languages is fun and rewarding, but if the work itself is boring then I'll never be satisfied. Serving customers gives me confidence, but it's not something I can do for the rest of my life.

Even if my hospitality career moves on to the highest echelons of gourmet, top-of-the-line service, I'm not sure if I'll be proud of myself.

I want to work in technology. I've loved technology since I knew what laptops were. When I do bring myself to solve problems, I get it. I think I can really make an impact at a software company someday.

Maybe I'll do that for a while. And then I'll retire and work at a wine bar. Or something.

Hmm.
