It's time to start studying for finals. I'm going to post about each data structure I'm going to be tested on.

* BST Bag
* AVL Tree Bag
* Tree Sorting
* Tree Traversal
* Tree Iterator
* Heaps
* Heap Sort
* Hash Tables
* Graphs

I also want to go back and post about the topics we had on the midterm since those are pretty foundational for understanding what's on the final. I'm not sure if I'll have time for all of it though, since my final is on Sunday and I still have <s>two</s> three huge assignments due.

* Levels of abstraction
* Basic Array
* Data structure vs. ADT

Stack:

* Dynamic Array Stack
* Linked List Stack

Queue:

* Linked List Queue

Bag:

* Dynamic Array Bag

* Linked List Iterator
* Binary Search
