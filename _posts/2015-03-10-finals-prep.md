It's time to start studying for finals. I'm going to post about each data structure I'm going to be tested on.

* Generic BST
* Generic AVL Tree
* Tree Sorting
* Tree Traversal
* Tree Iterator
* Heaps
* Heap Sort
* Hash Tables
* Graphs

I also want to go back and post about the topics we had on the midterm since those are pretty foundational for understanding what's on the final. I'm not sure if I'll have time for all of it though, since my final is on Sunday and I still have <s>two</s> three huge assignments due.

* Big-O notation
* Levels of abstraction
* Basic Array
* Dynamic Array Stack
* Linked List Stack
* Dynamic Array Queue
* Linked List Queue
* Dynamic Array Deque
* Linked List Deque
* Linked List Iterator
* Binary Search
