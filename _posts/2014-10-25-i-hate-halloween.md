title: I Hate Halloween

I hate the pressure to go crazy. I never feel like going to parties. Or dressing up. Or bothering with any Halloween traditions at all. I've hated Halloween since my freshman year of college.

I hate when Daylight Savings Time ends. It means I wasted the past six months not enjoying the sun enough. I'll have to wait until next spring to work on my tan, and I'll probably be too busy then. What happened to going to the beach? Going to the park? Chic outdoor cocktail parties? Getting in shape? I've failed my youth, yet again.

I hate the scary stories and zombie costumes. I hate the groaning and screams and evil laughter. I hate being reminded of how easily I get scared.

I hate how somehow, every fall, I seem to get depressed again. I already know I have Seasonal Affectedness Disorder but I thought it would get better back here in LA. I guess I don't get outside enough.

I hate how I bite off more than I can chew in the fall and I consistently disappoint myself, every year. What am I supposed to do, less? I can't wait that long. Why can't I manage my priorities better during this time? Is it really the weather causing this?

I hate this entire time between my birthday and New Year's. Bombarded with events and deadlines and holidays and reminded of what it means not to have a social life. My birthday, back to school, midterms, Halloween, Thanksgiving, finals, Hanukkah, Christmas, New Years. It's way too eventful.

I just want to skip into the new year. But then I'll have wasted another fall. Another birthday, another Halloween, another Christmas. Doing nothing. But honestly, holiday memories don't really stand out to me. It's other more unique events that I remember a lot more.

The only thing I like about this season is the clothes. And at this point I have nowhere to wear them. I hope that changes soon.

I guess I'm not really one to stand on tradition.
