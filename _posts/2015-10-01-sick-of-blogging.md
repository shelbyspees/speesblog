title: Sick of Blogging
---

I guess it's not really regular blogging I'm sick of. It's the intense research-synthesis-blogging I'm trying to do.

Once I figured out how to pull quotes from books and articles and discuss those in a way that doesn't totally suck, I decided I wanted to do that with all the nonfiction I care about. That's a lot.
  
Let me check Evernote.

I have 368 total notes in my Evernote. Let's say that half of them are somehow related to things I want to blog about. (I'm pretty sure it's more than half.) That's still 184 notes to go and reference. And I just spent the past several weeks cleaning out all the listicles and school assignments that I don't need Evernote to keep track of. I probably deleted over 100 notes I didn't need.

Here are all my tags. Now, not all of my notes are tagged. I've done a great job of improving how I tag my notes but it's taken me a long time to make a system for myself. Tagging hasn't always been natural for me.

The main thing that's been hard for me, though, is getting handle on all the quotes I want to reference in my blog posts. A lot of the time articles or interviews or books will talk about a bunch of different topics that interest me, so tagging the entire article/note in Evernote isn't helpful for finding the really impactful bits.

I've highlighted the crap out of a lot of these articles. This is the main reason why I use Evernote, actually. If I'm reading an article or a blog post online and I think, "Man, I wish I could highlight that," it gets clipped to Evernote immediately. Then just `control` + `command` + `H`. (Also, it's amazing that Evernote and Preview have the same keyboard shortcut for highlighting. It's the little things.)

But until now I hadn't figured out a way to collect those highlighted sections so it's easy to link back to the original article. Regular text lists aren't visual enough, plus it's hard to organize by topic. Even Scrivener---though I admit I'm still learning all the features---seemed to over-complicate my quote-collecting.

In walks Trello.

I've been resisting Trello for years. I couldn't find a use for it before. But I get it now. It's not a to-do list. It's not a task list. It's a hierarchy of ideas.

There are a million ways to use Trello. My way probably isn't the most exciting but I'll show what I've done. 

The screenshot above is titled "Software Writing" because each list in the board was to be an outline for an article. (It's getting too big though so I might have to break it up somehow. I wanted to keep everything in this one board so I can just copy over all my quotes from Evernote into "New". Then I'll move them around among the lists depending on whatever topic they fit best. Breaking it up into separate boards will be hard since I don't have all the possible topics yet.)

...Never mind I think I figured it out.

For each topic I'd populate it with quote-notes and then add my own notes to basically outline the entire article. Then once I felt I did the topic justice I'd copy the contents of the list over to a text file and round it out. I love outlines.

So far I have the following lists/topics:

- Leadership
- Craftsmanship
- Project Management
- People Skills
- Process
- Documentation
- Confidence/Imposter Syndrome
- Dunning-Kruger
- Corporate
- Other

My "New" list is where I'm dumping all my quotes until I move them to the appropriate topic. Basically when enough quotes share a topic that's not accounted for, I make a new list for it.

By the way, I'm still on `A`. Yeah, I'm going alphabetically. Because this is the way I decided to do it. And a lot of these articles *haven't* been highlighted.
  
It's a process. By the end, though, I'll have the best collection of software career quotes you've ever seen in your life.

Writing isn't something you can automate. It needs a brain in there somewhere. I'm hoping to synthesize and clarify these ideas put out there by other writers. Because it's easier than being creative.
