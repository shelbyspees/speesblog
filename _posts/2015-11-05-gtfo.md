Last week Misha and I were talking about travel and we decided to take a trip to Paris together for a week in the spring. She's never been out of the country and I've had the wanderlust itch for over a year now so I think it'll be a good opportunity for both of us. I'll be acting as travel agent/tour guide/translator.

Obviously I've made a lot of headway on my packing list. We're planning to go the last week of March because it's her spring break and my first week of spring quarter, and at that time Paris temperatures hover around 9Â°C. That's pretty cold but not unbearable with a good coat. It stayed in the single-digits during most of winter when I was in Tokyo and I liked it a lot.
  
It'll be a lot rainier in Paris though.
