I'm coming up on the end of my internship. One of the things interns in my division are expected to do is to perform a presentation called an *outbrief* in front of the higher ups in their department or subdivision.

Luckily my manager warned me about it on my first day. I've had ideas mulling around in the back of my head this entire summer so it's not like I'll run out of things to say. On the contrary, I have to take extra care that I don't ramble.

Plus since I'll be presenting for technical managers I have to be very careful not to waste their time. Sigh. Writing about it isn't going to make my presentation better though.

There is one thing I'd like to vent about though. And I mean vent in the most loving way. These projects I've been working on--they've been so much more complicated than I could have ever anticipated. I knew I'd be interacting with large, complex software systems, but going into this internship I thought I'd be doing maintenance and fixing bugs. Building these large systems that interact with other systems from scratch was nowhere on my radar.

Oh, what a learning experience. I'll go through a list of the technologies I've been exposed to through the work I've been doing this summer:

###Project I:

- Java
- ANTLR 4
- StringTemplate 4
- programming language theory
- various Java libraries
- Eclipse IDE
- proxy configuration in Eclipse, Git, Windows
- arg configuration in Eclipse
- Windows environment variables
- Git: branches, cloning, merging
- Redmine: project management, code history

###Project II:

- Python 2.7
- Python 3.4
- pywin32
- Microsoft Excel
- Visual Basic for Applications
- Windows environment variables
- Git
- PyInstaller
- PyQt 5

###Other Skills:

- Gathering requirements
- Research, research, research
- Designing a large system
- Debugging
- Refactoring
- Writing documentation
- Asking questions
- Project management
