Exercise is the closest thing to a magic cure-all that we have. That I have. When I sunk into darkness again back in October and November, exercise was what pulled me out.

According to The Willpower Instinct, exercise promotes blood flow to the pre-frontal cortex, which is the part of the brain responsible for higher-level decision making. It's also kind of good for the heart and lungs and muscles and other things.

Meditation also strengthens the pre-frontal cortex because meditation is just repeated practice of bringing one's awareness back to the breath. The mind will wander, and you just go back to the breath. Practicing this improves the brain's ability to maintain attention on whatever activity the user is trying to focus on.

Exercise and meditation. So simple, and yet I'll do anything in my power to avoid them. And it's destroying me.
