This is it. I'm crossing a milestone right now.
  
I'm halfway through my twenties. I'm currently commemorating this moment with a now-empty bottle of Bordeaux Rosé and Beyoncé and now Britney Spears. Because my apartment, my rules.

Living alone has been my dream since middle school. I've always loved being home alone. I've always been able to entertain myself. Plus chilling at home saves money.

My face feels smiley. Ahaha.

Honestly though, this past week has been seriously mind-blowing. I have an office. I have a career-type job. I have an apartment. I have real income. Six months ago I thought I'd be hustling for mediocre internships at this point. Now I can say I work on awesome software tools that support global communication networks.

My projects at work are interesting and challenging. My supervisors trust me to get things done. I'm constantly learning. I'm accomplishing really impressive things. Like, what?

When did my life start going well? How long is it going to last? I was telling people that I felt like Cinderella. When is the clock going to strike midnight?

They hired me for my potential. I still can't wrap my head around that idea. I had a bit of an episode a few weeks ago when it finally hit me that things have been actually going this well for me lately.

June 2012 I graduated from UCSB with a B.A. in linguistics. I was offered a full-time, year-commitment, unpaid volunteer internship doing work mostly related to the career that interested me: urban planning. I didn't take it because my car was too unreliable.

Like, what? There's no way I could have supported myself working forty hours a week unpaid for a solid year. But I seriously considered that position.

I'm still the same person now. But I'm valued. I'm full-time-with-benefits valued.  

What really messes with me is that I'm not very different from my friends who are working 1x-2x as hard as me. Why am I so lucky? Is it just because I happened upon the right [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/), the right job postings, the right major?

That's really the clincher. The major.
  
I'm having like, reverse imposter syndrome. Or like, it's imposter syndrome, just a different flavor. I'm great at social science. I'm decent at the humanities. But now being able to call myself an engineer? I'm in shock.

My level four manager said that it's normal to feel these kinds of emotions after such a big life change. Going back to school and changing careers is nearly as big a deal as getting married or having kids. Plus I've had some significant moves over the past three years.
  
I like myself better now than I did at 21. Definitely better than at 20.

I guess I should be focusing on the future. Immediate goals include my project deliverables and school. Gotta keep that GPA up.

Beyond that I really want to prioritize my health. Gym, food, sleep. I honestly think I'll do better if I never compromise on health.  

I have a few unrelated things I'm interested in. I've written about dipping my toes into fiction writing. Because why not? I think it'll balance out the technical work, plus maybe it'll make me better at people. People are hard.

I'd like to feel good in my body again. I'm so weak and slow. And I'm tired of my legs and back cramping up. I want to feel young in my body. And that's totally doable still at this point.

Something else I shouldn't ignore is my social life. I cancelled my end-of-summer party last Friday because the move sapped all my energy. I shouldn't let myself flake going forward. Working alone and living alone is going to drive me crazy if I don't have some social outlets.

And the relationship thing. Ugh. I'm entering my 'late' twenties. I wouldn't call them late, really. I feel like they came early. >.>

Before this summer I had an excuse. I didn't want to get married until same-sex marriage was legal in all fifty states. Well I was living under a rock all through May and June so the Supreme Court decision totally snuck up on me. 

Now I have no excuse. I can marry whomever I want whenever I want. That is, if there's anyone who'd want to marry me.

I'm such a commitment-phobe. I can't imagine any of my friends getting married or having kids. Especially not me. Not like I'm my friend, but you know.

FEELINGS. WHAT.

A few months ago I was hoping I'd be able to move out before the end of the year, but I highly doubted that possibilty. I mean, I thought I might be able to rent half a room from some random on Craigslist. This is so much better: my couch, my kitchen, my bedroom, my bathroom. Aw man.

This has been my dream since 7th grade. I don't know how to feel. Just, shock.

Btw tonight is Friday. Just like every other day that ends in 'y', it's Beyoncé Worship Day. How does one worship Queen Bey? Listening, dancing, singing, appreciating, feeling. She makes me feel so many things. Maybe that's the wine though. Mmm.
