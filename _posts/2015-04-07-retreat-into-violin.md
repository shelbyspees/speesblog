For the past week or so I've been itching to play violin.

I haven't picked up my violin since October, when I reorganized my room and [packed my backpack](http://shelbyspees.github.io/speesblog/travel/2014/10/27/backpacking.html) to see how little I can live with. I decided to stow away my binders of sheet music on a shelf in my closet and I started using my music stand as a clothes rack.

Last year when I first came back from Japan I made a commitment to play violin at least once a day. I kept it up for weeks. It was frustrating at first, then relaxing and fun when my skills were warmed up, and then frustrating again when my old habits started coming back to haunt me. For some reason I get really stiff when I play, and after about ten minutes my back starts to hurt. It's probably more of a problem standing than sitting, but I've been dealing with these posture issues since high school.

Over the weekend when I was working on my assignments I had the strongest urge to play. Usually I get this urge when I hear some great music in the background at a store or restaurant. This time I couldn't really pinpoint my motivation to play. I just had this tingling feeling in my arms and hands and mind drawing me to it.

It was hard to find a good time though. I usually get my musical urges at inappropriate times, like late at night when my parents are asleep or right before I'm supposed to head into work.

So earlier today when I felt the same urge and I realized it was a good time, I finally pulled out my case and opened it up. I wasn't sure how much of my skills I'd lost, but once I put some music in front of me I was surprised how decent I sounded.

As I continued looking through my sheet music I realized exactly what I was doing. I was [retreating into competence](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch02.html#retreat_into_competence). When I first read that section I knew it was important, but I thought it would be a while before I have any skills that I can retreat into. But here I was stretching the violin muscles I spent nearly ten years developing.

It finally hit me. These are my competencies.

This is why I would sing every day on my commute to and from my internship. The burden of all the things I was trying to learn was temporarily lifted by the relief of actually being good at something. Yeah, I sing pretty well. It keeps me sane.

It's funny, I actually had this idea in mind when I started my CS classes last June. I knew violin would restore my energy a bit when I got tired of consuming computer knowledge. Whether it was from the increased blood flow, the change of pace, or the chance to do something I don't suck at didn't matter. I guess it was all of the above.

Unfortunately the resorative powers of my violin-playing are pretty limited. It stops being fun and refreshing when (a) my back starts killing me or (b) I realize how hard I'd have to work if I wanted to improve even a little. Usually the back thing happens a lot sooner than the improvement thing, but if I fight the pain long enough to reach (b) then it's doubly depressing.

Luckily for me I have lots of things I'm sort of competent at in case I want to apply that apprenticeship pattern:

- violin
- singing
- reading
- writing
- teaching
- eating
- drinking

Actually, I'm not so sure about those last two. I choke on water several times a week. Maybe I'm just bad at breathing.

Hopefully programming will join that list soon. Like in the next few years or so.
