I'm on a no-buy for 2016. At least until April, but probably for the rest of the year. I already have more stuff than I'll ever need. There's nothing I should be spending money on.

So I went ahead and bought my birthday gift. I'm going to see Hamilton on Broadway in September. Original cast. Orchestra seats.

>*Ayo I'm just like my country*  
>*I'm young, scrappy, and hungry*  
>*And I'm not throwin away my shot*  

This is the musical I needed in my life.
