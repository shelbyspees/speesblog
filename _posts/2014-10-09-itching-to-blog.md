I have a lot of thoughts lately. I'm glad I got rid of my old blog but I think it'll be nice to try out a new platform for a while.

Just now I finished reading [Becoming a Technical Leader](http://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Technical-Leader-Gerald-Weinberg-ebook/dp/B004J4VV3I/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=8-1&qid=1413336480) by Gerald Weinberg. Obviously I'm not a technical anything quite yet but I absolutely believe that this book is a great resource for any remotely technically-minded person hoping to solve personal and organizational problems in their lives.

The deeper I get into my CS coursework the more I resist letting go of the meager people skills I've fought hard to develop. When I think about how different I am now compared to my senior year of high school, well, I'm glad I didn't go into a STEM field right away. Tech companies need more compassionate, thoughtful problem-solvers. I hope to join the ranks soon.
