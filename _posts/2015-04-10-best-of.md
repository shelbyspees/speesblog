After linking several articles on reddit just now after someone referenced one I know I saved, I realized my article-hoarding tendencies could be put to good use.

I left out the listicles and most of [The Muse](https://www.themuse.com/advice/) articles I've saved since those are pretty short and easy to consume. My list mostly consists of longer articles that require some convincing before people bother to read them.
