This is the second post in a series meant to summarize the principles of *[The Leadership Challenge](http://www.amazon.com/Leadership-Challenge-4th-James-Kouzes/dp/0787984914/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=8-2&qid=1415953746)* through direct quotations from the book. 

This is a personal project meant purely for educational purposes, and if any toes have been stepped on feel free to reach out to me on Twitter [<i class="fa fa-twitter"></i> @speesbag](https://twitter.com/speesbag/).

(The way I approached this project means it's going to take me a long time to finish. I'm not in a hurry though. I might scale this down to a single-post book review with summaries instead of direct quotes.)
