I've been posting some obnoxious tweets lately.

Yes, my newest motivation to work out is the eye candy to be found at LA Fitness. Gosh, how horrible, right? Shouldn't I be motivated by more important things like my cardiovascular health or my longevity or how good I'm going to look in a bikini this summer? Also, creepy much?

Well I say, "Screw that!" What difference does it make what my motivation is? None, because I get all the same benefits as the people who use the elliptical every day to stop themselves from dying of heart disease at 52. 

Also it's only creepy if I stare or approach people. Peripheral appreciation is totally ok.

Actually, here's my semi-complete list of motivations to go to the gym, in order of importance:

1. Eye candy
2. Getting my money's worth
3. Reducing back pain
4. Lessening the impact of my shit mental health (I hate how well it works)
5. Making my stomach less bloaty--this actually happens when I work out. I like being able to tie my shoes.
6. Looking slightly less bad in a bikini (but fat loss is all about diet anyway)
7. Being less out of breath if I have to run to catch a bus
8. Being significantly less out of shape one/five/ten year(s) from now

The first two will keep me on my goal of going every day. The rest are just consolation prizes.

Things I don't really care about:

1. Living to be 90 (ew, I don't even want to think about the wrinkles. Plus I'm probably gonna die of skin cancer anyway)
2. Not having a heart attack at 50 (because again, skin cancer)

Anyway, I'm hungry from all that cardio. 

P.S. Someday I'll get back into lifting, at which point I'll be so insanely hot that the world won't know what hit it. I'm putting it off to keep the global economy from collapsing because I'm just that nice.
