I haven't posted in a couple days. I'm pretty concerned about my school performance. 

I have good reasons to be doing this. I actually like this stuff. This is how my brain works. I love finding patterns and exceptions. But I don't appreciate it. I'm not working hard. I'm already mentally rewarding myself for success I haven't reached yet. 

All day today I thought about what it would be like to go backpacking. For years I've been dreaming (sometimes obsessing) about living out of one bag. Seeing how extreme my minimalism could go.

The best vacation I've ever had was the two days I was completely alone in Kyoto. Second to that was when I was in Manhattan walking around on my own. I love solo travel. I love exploring and making my own decisions about where to go and what to do. 

I wanna get on a bus to Mexico and just continue south as far as I can go. Maybe I'm naive thinking that I'd be safe alone in these places. I'm definitely naive if I think my parents would be cool with me doing this. 

I want to go to Europe. France, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, the Netherlands. I want to visit Northern Africa. Southeast Asia. The Caribbean. 

I feel so trapped in my life right now. Until today I felt really comfortable with staying here for a while, but now I'm itching to leave again. I want to sleep on busses and trains and inside airport terminals. I want to carry everything I need on my back, without really needing much of anything. I want to walk and hitchhike and get lost.
