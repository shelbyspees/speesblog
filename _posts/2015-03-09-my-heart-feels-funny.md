My anxiety has been through the roof the past few weeks. I don't like making excuses for myself but it's been very hard to focus.

My mom is having surgery on Friday. It'll be a complete hysterectomy to remove her uterine cancer. She was nervous at first but after she learned she'd be on a respirator instead of just having a breathing mask is when she got really scared. She's had severe asthma her whole life, and when she was younger she never had her wisdom teeth out because back then they didn't put people with asthma on respirators. Well, it's been thirty years since then. I'm sure surgeons know how to handle people with asthma now.

I'm really the level-headed one in the family so I try to keep things light. My dad doesn't handle medical stuff well at all, but I don't really mind. I'd rather know about a condition and have resources to improve it than live with my head in the sand, continually getting worse. Doctors and nurses are super nice and helpful. At least with most cancers you know when it's there and when it's gone. Mental illness is a lot harder to pinpoint. (You know, for example.)

We're lucky to have my aunt Paula at least. She was my grandmother's caretaker for over twenty years, and my grandfather's caretaker before that. People often ask if she works in the medical field, since she's so knowledgeable.

But I guess beneath my jokes about how cool it's gonna be that she's having surgery done with a robot, there's a knot of fear tighting deep inside. I mean, she looks so young. Nothing bad can happen, right? Well the minute you start saying that is the minute bad things start happening.

Talking about the worst case scenario will jinx it, but not being prepared for the worst will also jinx it.

I'm just not ready to lose her yet. When she told me about the cancer I could just see it in her face. She needs me, and I need her.

I'm a crappy daughter. The best I could do was buy her flowers and watch TV with her. Sure, I'll buy groceries and make sure the house stays clean while she recovers. But I'm not really there for her, emotionally.

I just keep going back to how I would deal if something bad were to happen. I can't support my dad, and his business won't stay afloat without her. Nobody on my dad's side of the family can take care of my grandpa's medical paperwork. My aunt and uncle just moved out of state last year. And I'm planning to leave LA within the next year anyway.

She can't go yet. It's not time.

So I guess this is getting to me. I'm holding back from writing all the sad thoughts spiraling through my mind. 

I mean, how can I care about this stupid school assignment I'm never going to look at again when my mom is lonely and scared? 

How can I blow off school when my parents are going to need me to support them, probably within the next ten years?

Either way I feel guilty. And I feel guilty for making this about me.
