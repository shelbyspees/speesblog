Years ago I read [<i class="fa fa-book"></i> *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change*](http://smile.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Anniversary-ebook/dp/B00GOZV3TM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1423798461&sr=8-1&keywords=7+habits) by Stephen R. Covey.

I am 100% convinced that these (capital-H) Habits are all it takes to live a happy, full successful life. Unfortunately the Habits aren't small simple actions like, "Brush your teeth everyday" or "Smile every time you make eye contact with somebody." The word "Habits" in the title is misleading, the book is more a collection of attitudes, mindsets, and ways to act. But if you take the time to understand where the book is trying to lead you, you'll find yourself closer to the kind of life you want to live.

Actually, that's why I'm doing this book review. I noticed myself diverging from my intended path this past month or so and getting further away from the version of myself I'm trying to be. This book has helped me in the past by reminding me of my values and intentions, so I'm hoping that doing some review will get me back on that path of intentionality, integrity, and balance.

The thing about this book is that it intellectualizes and jargonizes the basics of being a decent person. This is great for nerds like me who will spend weeks writing and rewriting and introspecting in order to hammer out a polished personal mission statement. But the nerdy approach is overkill, and I honestly think the best way to go about forming these Habits is the simplest one. So I'm going to try breaking apart some of these businessy catch phrases into chunks that are a bit easier to swallow with the hope that that everybody can understand, relate to, and easily apply the Habits to their lives.

The first three Habits are internal. Covey discusses the importance of transcending interpersonal dependence and reaching independence with help from the first three Habits. This section of the book really spoke to me.


## Habit 1: Be Proactive

The first Habit is at the top of the list for a reason. Nothing you want in life is going to come about unless you take action. It's the foundation of every other Habit on the list.

Years ago, when I was 18, I learned a word that has stuck with me for a long time: *integrity*. The definition I've hung on to is this:

>Integrity is doing what you said you were gonna do when you said you were gonna do it.

That's it. You decide to do something, and then you do it. When you said you would. If circumstances don't allow you to complete this action, you find a way to make up for it. Reschedule, or whatever. Sounds simple, right?

But we have such a hard time with it. Maybe we're good for a while, but then we slip up one day and fail to balance things out again. And then when we slip up again the next day, we're so off balance that we say, "Screw it." Indulge for a while, do better next time.

We will screw up. We will go off balance. It's important to take the steps necessary to regain that balance and maintain those streaks.


## Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind

I think I've been imagining my own funeral since I was a kid, but it definitely became more vivid after trying the exercises in this chapter. You're supposed to imagine what you want people to say about you at your eulogy. The idea is that the person your loved ones describe at your eulogy is the person you want yourself to be.

Since my family and friends say nice things about me all the time, I had to dig a little deeper to find that vision of the ideal me. But she's there. She's been there since I was a child. That tall, smart, confident, important woman in a killer suit.

The word "End" and the funeral exercise for this Habit are a bit misleading. I won't really care what happens once I'm dead; I'll be dead. But I know there's a better version of myself that I'm capable of being. That motivates me.

## Habit 3: Put First Things First

"But... you just told me to begin with the *end*. Now I'm supposed to start with what's *first*??" Yes.

Habit 2 was about the bird's-eye view of how you want your life to be. Habit 3 is about what happens on the ground.

Putting first things first is about doing the things that are available to you now to get you closer to your Habit 2 Self. The Urgency vs. Importance matrix is super useful to understand here.

<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/comp/urgency-importance.png"/>

These are just some token examples, but I want you to notice Quadrant II. Exercise, meditation, stretching, studying--the things I'm most likely to put off.

The idea here is that we often blow off important things because they're not blaring alarms in our ears all the time. How can we combat this? By putting first things first. I'll translate.

You only have access to now. You can't change the past; you can't know the future. Each moment is a choice. You can choose to click over to reddit (or keep the tab open after subconsciously typing "red" + enter). You can get up to refill your water bottle. You can click "Keep Playing" when Netflix hounds you for watching too many episodes of House, or you can close your laptop and go to the gym. Tiny choices, but they add up in the long run.

The "first" in Put First Things First is to take advantage of the opportunities that are immediately in front of you to make your life incrementally (or significantly) better. Doing the harder thing. As you continue to make these minor positive choices throughout your day, it'll become habitual. So the mindset Habits can help you build actual *habits*. Pretty great, huh?

The next three Habits are external. Social. These have always been harder for me to wrap my head around than the first three. I'm just too introspective, I guess.

## Habit 4: Think Win/Win

So clich√©, right? Everybody knows about compromise.

That's what I thought when I first read that chapter title. But Covey explains a new approach to handling conflict that leaves both parties better off than when they started.

In mainstream understanding, "Win/Win" means I get a little of what I wanted and you get a little of what you wanted, and it kind of sucks but it's better than drama/war/losing the contract. Covey's explanation of Win/Win is about finding a solution beyond what ideas either party had to start with that actually solves all the problems and leaves everyone satisfied.

You've probably heard of this as being "creative" or "thinking outside the box." Those are important attitudes to have when interacting with others. 

## Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, then to be Understood

This Habit changed my entire perspective as an educator, and I think it'll have rippling effects throughout my entire career.

I like helping people. I like giving advice. I like solving problems for people. But often we give advice based on our own narrow perspective. We solve the problems we think we see rather than the problems the person we're trying to help has. This is less helpful and more patronizing than anything.

When I was teaching English in Japan, my students were adults aged 25-65 working for various corporations in Tokyo. They had life experience, they had histories. There was only so much I had to teach them.

So I listened. I worked on my listening skills for months. I corrected their grammar, word choice, pronunciation, but I'd also give advice on ways to study or improve faster. Motivating students was a big part of my job description.

It was incredibly difficult at first. I like the sound my own voice. My students thought I was charismatic and confident. But I stopped caring what they thought about me and focused on how I can help each student improve their English.

Of course not every student needed or wanted advice, but most were there to improve. While not perfect, it was hugely rewarding when students came back to me and said that they were following my advice, or they felt more confident using English at work.

Here's an example of the repercussions of not following this guideline in the field of software:

Understanding the market, understanding customer needs, that's what builds a legacy. Understanding stakeholders and constituents is what helps the most people. Understanding your loved ones gives you the most influence, and it gives you the ability to wield that influence like a paintbrush rather than a club.

Listen. Ask questions. Ask for clarification. Paraphrase back to them. All of this before you utter a single suggestion. That's powerful stuff.

Don't just wait for your chance to speak. Chances are you may have something different to say once you truly understand what the other person is talking about.

## Habit 6: Synergize

Oh, that word. The most [jargony](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy) of them all. What the heck does it mean?

After reading this book a handful of times and pondering for a couple years, to me synergy can be described

>The situation where the whole ends up being greater than the sum of its parts.

A great example is music. Thinking back to my years as an orch dork, there were dozens of times when the different parts of the orchestra came together to make something absolutely incredible happen. Being in the middle of that is indescribable. It's like a high. (Shout out to [Ed Kawakami](http://www.onefiveone.org/) for being an enabler!)

People talk about synergy all the time. When everything just falls into place. When a team just jells. When something great happens beyond what you ever imagined. 

Falling in love is synergy. The miracle of birth is synergy. Amazing friends who just get you? That's synergy. Runner's high might be an example of synergy.

As the most cynical non-religious person you've ever met, I would say that synergy is the closest we mortals can get to the concept of a miracle. When something amazing happens that's just inexplicably better than you expected. 

The problem with this Habit is that it's not something you can just do. But it comes about when you have all your other ducks in a row. The orchestra can't shine as an ensemble unless everyone practices their individual parts.

## Habit 7: Sharpen the Saw

The final Habit on the list is a nice package for all the other Habits to reside in. Sharpening the saw is about paying attention to the little things so you don't waste your time going in the wrong direction.

To give away the punch line:

>I'm too busy trying to cut down this tree to bother sharpening my saw.

For example, if you're working so many hours to earn a comfortable salary that you're burning yourself out in the process, it defeats the purpose of having a comfortable income because you won't be comfortable anyway. 

It's about minor course corrections, maintaining awareness of how your present activities diverge from your ideal path.
