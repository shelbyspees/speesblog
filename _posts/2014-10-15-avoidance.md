I discourage myself. I compare myself to others. Then I lie to myself. 

## Stress-Reducing Thoughts:

**Preparation:** "I can do this."

**Confronting the Stress:** "I like this."

**Coping with the Emotions:**

* "It's almost over."
* "It'll be over soon."
* "I've handled worse than this before."
* "Keep my mind on the present."

**Success:** "I'm pretty awesome."

Reinforce success.

Be aware of my feelings of avoidance. I don't have to be right or wrong.

My motivation for success is this:

> I want to be good at it.

It's simple. It's me. It's not about comparing or competing. It's 100% in my control.

Comparing myself to others is sabotage. Become aware of my thoughts. Projection is perception.
