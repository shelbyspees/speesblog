The other day I noticed my resting heart rate was like way high and I figure this way I can track everything and it'll keep me motivated to exercise and eat right.

Also now I can be like Skye in [*Agents of SHIELD*](http://abc.go.com/shows/marvels-agents-of-shield)

Yay, data! Yay, health! Yay, technology that looks really good with my all-black outfits!
