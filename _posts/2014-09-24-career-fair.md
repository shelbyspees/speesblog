I went to a career fair today and it was awesome. It made me realize how much I've learned about careers in the real world since my time at UCSB.

Until last year I completely disregarded any jobs that required some level of business acumen. I didn't want to do financial analysis, marketing, business planning, sales. And I had no idea what jobs were that real people did in the real world. 

When we're kids we learn about doctors and lawyers, police officers and firemen, teachers and presidents. Then at some point most kids learn about corporate jobs from their parents, who have corporate jobs. They hear about Joe the accountant or Mary the business analyst or Tom in market research. My parents didn't have corporate jobs. For six years my mom held three jobs, none of which were corporate. They ran businesses, but it didn't look like business.

I've been reading a book lately called Coders At Work. It's a series of interviews with famous great minds in software in the 90s and early 00s. Granted, I'm only on the second interview, but combined with things I've read online about successful people in software, the main theme is that they started young. Very young. Like, these kids are barely reading and they get sat in front of a computer. Well, it's not like computers were dropping out of the sky in 1985 (normally). Their parents had resources. Actually, usually there was an engineer in the family.

Here I would like to point out that I had never heard the word "engineer" used outside of a locomotive context before 2007.

Now, my parents are great. They've run or helped run three successful family businesses in different parts of the family. My dad has the heart of an engineer if not the job title. There isn't a problem he won't try to fix.

Guys like my dad, though. They don't get a salary. They don't make benefits. I was always confused around Father's Day in elementary school because I had never seen my dad wear a tie. Guys like my dad look like Stu Pickles from Rugrats. Tinkering in the basement or backyard, climbing back into the living room covered in grease and soot. The qualities that drive these hobbies are admirable, sure. But when your parents tell you to go to college, you imagine a career quite free of soot. At least I did.

So yes, I'm claiming ignorance. I mean, I was so ignorant that I auditioned for the violin performance major back when I started at UCSB. The violin instructor made me cry and told me to major in something else so I can keep violin as a hobby. He said if I majored in violin then I'd get sick of it, or something. 

In hindsight, he was right, but the timing was horrible. I was undeclared, alone, insecure, miserable, and surrounded by happy, beautiful people. Didn't make many friends that year.

From 2007 to 2010 I sank deeper and deeper into a functioning depression until a series of events triggered a two-month depressed episode where I stopped eating, stopped talking to people, stopped getting out of bed. That was my study abroad experience in Bordeaux. I left halfway through the year, transferring one class, and I quit French after seven years of study.

So it's probably best that my major was really brainless because if I had been doing anything whatsoever challenging then I probably would have needed to drop out of college.

Once I got stable I realized my linguistics coursework was indeed brainless and became bitter about my job prospects. This is where I get closer to my point. 

My strongest motivation was to live abroad again, so I stuck with that. Applied to JET and started looking into teaching jobs in Tokyo. I realized that with my degree I was totally qualified, so after twiddling my thumbs for six months (meanwhile eliminating urban planning as a career option, and gaining an interest in GIS) I flew to Japan. You know that story.

It was mostly laziness that made me choose the adult conversation instructor position. It was between that and a preschool teaching aide position where I would have to create my own lesson plans. It sounded like a ton of work and long hours so I went with the conversation instructor position.

Every day I'd meet new students and ask them about their jobs. Jobs were easier to talk about than families or significant others or hobbies. Often, students didn't have time for hobbies because they were so busy at their jobs. And I just hate asking people about their personal lives. So lesson warm-ups would go like this:

* Nice to meet you
* Where are you from?
* What do you do?
* How was your weekend? (or similar topic)

If I knew the student then I'd skip to the fourth question. At the end of the lesson, if there was time, I'd ask about their plans for next weekend or whatever holiday. Obviously the order and timing would vary but it was good practice for them.

Most of my students worked jobs that paid well enough so they could afford English lessons, or jobs that required them to speak English fairly well. Lots of pharmaceutical researchers, systems engineers, business analysts. This was my first time hearing about these sort of technical positions. They actually sounded interesting. And my job was to force my students to explain their jobs to me, so I ended up learning a lot about how their companies worked.

Lately I realized that I'm pretty good at most of the jobs I've ever tried to do. I learn quickly and listen and cooperate and devote myself to whatever part of the company's mission that I most closely align with. I'm quick and articulate and friendly and pretty smart most of the time. I can present myself like a professional or in myriad other ways as necessary (cute, sexy, young, mature, androgynous, smart, etc.).

Since coming back from Japan I've been dreaming of an air-conditioned office job that'll allow me to wear all the cute office clothes I've accumulated and actually use my brain every so often. And recently I was presented with several opportunities to live that dream. To type at my desk in my ergonomically correct chair and attend meetings around long oval tables with white boards and projector screens. I don't know what would be discussed in these meetings but this is what I've wanted since I was a little girl. Business Woman Barbie(R). But without the exploitation or whatever.

So many conflicting goals in my ignorant little head.

Speaking to recruiters at the career fair made me realize how confident I've become, and for good reason. Sure, I have a zillion things left to learn. But I'll get there, and I'll kick ass, and the only person stopping me is myself.
