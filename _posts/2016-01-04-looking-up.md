After several weeks of casual consideration, I've decided that my new year's resolution is to love myself.

I know what needs to happen for me to be healthy, successful, happy. But I don't like myself enough to do those things. I've pinpointed the issue, now I can work on solving it.

If I say my resolution is to exercise more, then it becomes unfun punishment, and when I don't exercise I'll feel guilty. Not a recipe for long-term improvement.

If I say my resolution is to budget and spend less, I'll feel burdened by the tedium and restrictions.

If I say my resolution is the cook more and eat healthy, I'll most definitely fail. I won't care about myself enough to bother.

If my resolution is to dive into school, it'll be about the homework rather than the learning. I'll get sick of it and drop the ball.

My hope is that loving myself will have positive side effects. I'll want to feel good in my body. I won't need to spend money or eat crap as a temporary high. I'll enjoy learning and developing my skills. I'll feel like it's worth it to spend time taking care of myself.

I've been discussing this loving-myself thing with friends for probably a year. I thought it was normal to hate one's self. It's the human condition. Apparently not?

And when my friends asked why I wanted to binge on ice cream and why I didn't exercise even though I knew it would help significantly, I didn't know what to tell them. It's taken me a long time to learn what to do to be healthy, but now I know. Ignorance is no longer an excuse.

After much prying (I'm so lucky to have the friends I have), a series of "why"s revealed that I don't take care of myself because I don't care about myself. I don't want to be happy. I want to punish myself, or at least ignore myself.

So this year I will love myself. I'll look in the mirror every day and say "I love you." I'll appreciate myself and take care of myself and enjoy myself. Heck, maybe I'll even date myself. I'll love myself, the verb.

One thing I want to mention is that I've struggled for a long time reconciling who I am on paper--smart, ambitious, pretty, fun--with the way I've been treated while dating. I don't think I'm the shit. I know I'm not a model. But shouldn't at least a couple people want to go out of their way to spend time with me? Shouldn't someone want to learn how I tick? Shouldn't I be pursued for something more than a dozen casual flings?

A lot of my dating philosophy has been influenced by "he's just not that into you." If you feel like crap in a relationship situation and the other person isn't doing everything in their power to improve things, you should move on. Do you really want to spend your time with someone who doesn't want to make you happy?

Well, it turns out I'm not crazy. It turns out I'm actually pretty cool, and pretty smart, and pretty fun. Of course I couldn't believe my friends when they told me (what do they know?) but I've gotten feedback from some new perspectives and it's insanely healing. It's not me, it's the emotionally-unavailable jerks who continually flake when I allow them in my life.

I deserve to be loved, most of all by myself. I deserve to be treated well and appreciated. I deserve to be intellectually, emotionally, and physically stimulated. It's lonely to drop the losers who treat me like crap,  but I like myself better this way. And I'll be in a better place when I do meet someone who's worth my time. Especially when I have so much less of it now.

I want my relationships to be layered. Multitasking. Friends, partners, mentors, cheerleaders. This makes the precious time I do spend with the person even more exciting. Impactful? I'm economizing my time with better quality relationships.
