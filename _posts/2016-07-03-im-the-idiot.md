There have been a lot of themes in my dating life. One that I've been thinking about lately is the negative feelings I have toward men I no longer talk to. I'd like to try to unpack that.

I'm frustrated. I'm sick of dating. I don't think it's unreasonable for me to feel this way. But it's certainly not attractive to constantly rant about how much men suck. (At least, not to the guys I'd like to date. Among friends it's different. Men are the worst, amirite?)

It's illogical to try to date a positive person when I'm carrying around so much negativity. Positive people purposely don't surround themselves with that kind of negativity. If I want to date a positive person, I need to be a positive person.

So in trying to be a positive person--at least about my mediocre love life--I wanted to identify the negative themes that get repeated each time I break things off with somebody.

These two come up a lot:

1. "He was an idiot"
2. "I deserve better"

I'll discuss them separately.

## 1. "He was an idiot"

Apparently, I've dated a lot of idiots. That would be a reasonable conclusion to reach from the way I talk about the guys I've dated.

It's a funny thing about being someone who dates a lot of idiots, though. After a while it would seem that you're the idiot. I mean, wouldn't you have to be an idiot to be choosing to spend time with so many idiots? Who's the common denominator here?

Looking deeper at the so-called idiots I've dated, this is what often happens:

- We'll each want something different out of the relationship
- One or both of us will fail to communicate the different wants (or if they are communicated, someone--usually me--will fail to listen)
- I do some logical gymnastics to justify getting attached to this person because he's so *different*
- We'll each act according to the things we individually want
- I get mad when he doesn't meet my uncommunicated expectations
- I drop him when I realize he's not *different* and he's actually an idiot

What you as a reader can determine right away is that I'm the idiot. I'm the one who fails to communicate my desires. I'm the one who purposely ignores crucial information about where things are going (or not going, usually).

Part of my problem has been that I'm always scared to say outright that I want a relationship. I feel like it comes across as meaning

> *"I'll take anybody as long as I get a boyfriend."*

What I failed to realize was that my behavior is saying something even worse:

> *"I'll take anybody even if they're not going to be my boyfriend."*

This isn't what I want.

I don't mean that it's bad in the Puritan abstinance-only way like I'm such a skanky ho* for allowing these non-boyfriends to be intimate with me.

\* Note: There's no such thing as a "slut"/"ho"/"skank", there are just people who really enjoy sex.

If I didn't want a relationship then this wouldn't be a problem. It's a problem because I want one thing and I'm behaving as if I'm ok with something completely different and incompatible.

That brings me to my second point:

## 2. "I deserve better"

This isn't untrue. It's actually a fairly positive attitude to have. I deserve someone who wants to date me as I am.

I'm smart and fun and likable and I get attached very easily. I should be dating someone who's going to appreciate me and make me as happy as I'll make them.

Unfortunately, I have that irrational fear of seeming too serious. Because of this I have repeatedly failed to communicate my wants and needs when getting to know someone new.

Communication is important, folks. Failure to communicate is mutually assured destruction. So many problems could be avoided if people just opened their damn mouths early enough.

But of course, I've been a coward. I don't open my damn mouth and say what I want. I tolerate the mediocre crumbs of attention until the moment I realize: "I deserve better."

At that point I'm able to smother the feelings and push them out. I complain to my friends about how he's not different and why is it so hard to meet someone *mature*?

Except I'm not being mature. I'm not being better. Why should I expect something different if I keep doing the same thing?

I don't deserve better until I *am* better. Until I'm up front with my potential partners about my wants and needs.

It's a waste of time to tolerate the situationships I don't actually want. That's time I should be using to take care of myself.

That last part is so important. The kind of person I want to be with isn't going to want to be with me if I'm somebody who tolerates situationships and acts like an idiot and doesn't try to be better.

So really, when I say "I deserve better," it's not just from potential partners.

I deserve better from myself.
