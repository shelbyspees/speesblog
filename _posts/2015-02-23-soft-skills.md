This is so relevant for me right now:

>Like most people who come to programming “later” in life, I brought a bunch of life experience with me, far more than your average programmer with six months of experience. I had developed all sorts of interpersonal skills and psychological insights in my previous career. As I progressed as a programmer, I would meet people who would get very excited about my past, and **this led me to occasionally overvalue these softer skills, or overpursue nontechnical topics.** To be sure, my soft skills have served me well and have helped me tremendously in many situations; however, I have had to let these skills atrophy a bit in order to **focus the majority of my attention on developing my technical skills, which was obviously the area where I was most lacking.** I didn’t switch careers so I could be a therapist to programmers; I switched careers because I love the act of crafting software.
