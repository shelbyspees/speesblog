I've been reading and making notes on [<i class="fa fa-book"></i> *Apprenticeship Patterns*](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/index.html) by Dave Hoover and Adewale Oshineye.

When I read books like this, there are several ways I can approach it. Sometimes I'll just read the book straight through, but I'll usually highlight and make notes as I read. I'm doing that right now with [*Working with Emotional Intelligence*](). 

Another way I'll approach a book is by breaking it down into an outline or summary. You can see how I did that with [my post on *Solving the Procrastination Puzzle*](). This is also a useful way to approach my reading for school.

My favorite way, the most time-consuming, is to treat it like a workbook. Most of these non-fiction self-improvement books I read have questions or exercises for each chapter. I have a whole notebook in Evernote dedicated to all the questions in [*Becoming a Technical Leader*](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B004J4VV3I/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title), pictured below.
