I love writing. I love reading. I love writing about reading.

If only I had felt this way back in 11th grade AP English Language. Would have saved me a *lot* of tears.

I have a huge long list of books I've read that I'm halfway through marking up and outlining review posts for. [You should see my Evernote.]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-04-02-ignorance %})

Ideally I'd write a summary/review post for each book on my [reading page]({{ site.url }}/reading), but I'm not sure it'd be worth the time investment. I've already taken a bit of a hiatus from this blog because all the reading and analyzing started to feel like work on top of the actual work I need to get done.

I definitely feel like I want to document my learning process for each new topic I discover. Easier said than done. I'm in the middle of that with my recent (and unfinished as of this writing) ANTLR 4 walkthrough. As usual, I'm a starter but nowhere near a finisher.


There are so many great quotes I've gathered. I can't let them sit unused in my Evernote, collecting dust. Smart people have said smart things and I want to quote them, dammit!

But it's so much easier to write about writing. Meta-writing. Woah, that echoes in the brain.

The refreshing thing about fiction is that there is no research, at least not at this stage. It's all in my head. My job is to unbury the story living in my mind and transfer it to the page as accurately as possible. Since it's just me and my blank text editor, I don't have to worry about getting distracted by the black hole of knowledge that is Wikipedia or any half-finished writing in Evernote calling my name.
