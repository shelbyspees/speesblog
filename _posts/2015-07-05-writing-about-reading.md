I love writing. I love reading. I love writing about reading.

If only I had felt this way back in 11th grade AP English Language. Would have saved me a *lot* of tears.

I have a huge long list of books I've read that I'm halfway through marking up and outlining review posts for. You should see my Evernote.

Also, fun news! I updated the styling on my blog. It used to look like this:

<aside>Hooray for <code>git checkout</code> for letting me go back and take a screenshot without undoing all my changes. Version control saves the day again!</aside>

<img class="wide" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/files/oldcss.png"/>

And now it looks like this:

<img class="wide" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/files/newcss.png"/>
