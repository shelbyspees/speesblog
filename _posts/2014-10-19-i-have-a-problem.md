title: I have a problem
---

Why do I avoid? Surely it's not that I'm trying to prove how well I can do with the smallest amount of effort. But that's the way I've been doing things for like, ten years. 

I don't even enjoy the time-wasting. But something about doing what I'm supposed to be doing makes me want to throw up. It makes my skin crawl. My mind flashes with memories and images of when I tried to better myself and failed. 

There's something here.

I was always so intimidated by the smart boys in my classes. They played lots of sports, they read lots of books, they knew more about the world than I did. They were so confident. If I said something wrong, it was a reflection of my character. They didn't let me forget that.

This is why I started playing dumb in high school. At least they couldn't tell me I was dumb if I already acted like it. I still got good grades and learned a lot and improved, but I was finally unafraid to open my mouth in class. I couldn't compete playing by their rules so I made my own.

My game became, "See how well you can do with the least amount of effort possible." "Avoid notice to avoid criticism." "See? I can be funny. Just not clever."

But underneath that facade of nonchalance I could feel the ever-tightening knot of anxiety. I wasn't as good as them. I'll never be as good as them.

Why, six years later, do I still hear their voices? The snide comments. The dry sarcasm. The sharp criticism. It cut so deep.

Was it a type of bullying? Were they victims of a different kind of inferiority complex? I always imagined so. I can't be the only one with intellectual anxiety.

That's a good way to phrase it. Intellectual anxiety. School anxiety. Productivity anxiety? Well, there's definitely something going on there.

I feel like throwing up.
