So my internship ends on Friday. It was kind of short notice but I'm fine with that. I didn't feel comfortable making plans until I knew my mom's situation anyway. Stage 1A, best-case scenario all around. We're really glad.

She still feels crappy from the surgery so it's good that I'll be able to spend some time with her during her recovery. It's a chance for me to get a tan, learn AngularJS, and think about where I want to be six months from now.

Back in December I told myself I didn't want to spend another summer in the valley unless it was at this internship. Now that I won't be working here I really need to think about next steps.

I've been applying to internships around Santa Monica, but I know my car won't survive that commute every day. Plus I can't afford the gas. It eats at me every day to drive this gas-guzzling monster. I'm dying to live somewhere walkable.

On the other hand, I can't afford to live anywhere walkable. At least I'm not paying rent right now. I had started to save up some money but then my school put a hold on my account. That meant I couldn't register for classes until I paid off my account balance. (Not my student loan balance, just the few thousand dollars my loans won't cover each term.) So now I'm registered for spring but my bank account looks pitiful.

So that's what happened to the money I was earning in order to save up enough to move out.

Should I work as a server to save up to move? Sure, if I want my grades and mental health to take a nosedive. A few shifts here and there works great for spending money, but working enough to be able to move by summer would destroy me.

It's almost April and most Bay Area internships are filling up. Plus there's no guarantee I won't need a car in the Bay. 

LA requires a car. SD requires a car. The Bay requires a car. The central coast requires a car unless I live biking distance from my job, and I'm not sure I want to live in a small town again.

I could move to Portland or Seattle. Maybe. I don't know if I'm ready to leave all my family and friends to move out of state to work on some random CRUD app. I can do that here.

Update: I'm getting an A in Data Structures! Which means I'm pretty sure my GPA won't fall below a 3.5! Hooray #Astudent hell yeah
