It was 100F out today. Sounds about right.

I'm getting used to my internship. It's really great and I'm learning a ton. These first few weeks have been tough trying to wrap my head around the projects and actually being productive (rather than just consuming information). Now, though, I feel like by the end of the summer I'll have done something helpful if I just keep trying things and learning from my mistakes.

Yesterday and today they had panel discussions with full-time employees who answered questions for the interns. The full-timers ranged from a few years at the company to over 50 years. I thought it was crazy that someone had been working there as long as my mom's been alive.

The other interns are really chill. I'm sad that we'll only be working together for a few months. Maybe this time I'll try to stay friends with them beyond the summer. I'm working on being a better friend like that.

###Time

Now that I'm working 40 hours a week with 2+ hours of commuting a day, I've been thinking a lot about how I spend my time. After work and commuting, the next most important thing for me is sleep. Having been underemployed the past few months after my last internship ended, my stamina is completely disappeared. I got used to sleeping in and taking naps whenever I felt I needed to (most of the time). 

I just love sleep. It's the best feeling ever. I've been waking up at 4:00am to try to get to work by 6:00am, but usually I'll arrive around 6:30am because I just love having that extra time in my ridiculously comfortable bed.

After sitting on the 405 for an hour and a half I make it home and immediately change into pajamas. Yesterday I went to sleep at 7:00pm and woke up at 4:00am this morning. It was almost enough sleep for once.

Unfortuately, my work schedule, commute, and powerful need for sleep tend to get in the way of other things I'd like to be doing, like exercise. I've been to the gym once per week since I started my internship. Since I'm so out of shape I end up needing even more sleep for several days after a good workout.

If it were up to me, I'd find a room to rent over there and skip the whole commute thing. But at this point, $200 a month on car payments plus $160 a month on gas is still way cheaper than paying $200 a month on car payments plus $800+ a month on rent. 

At least now I can go places with a car that won't break down on me at the drop of a hat. I guess I really do value freedom.

One thing about my time that I've noticed is that I can't afford to waste it. I've met a few people and gone on dates the past few months. After dealing with the rampant flakiness here in LA I decided I'm not going to tolerate it anymore. Don't make me wait, don't waste my time, if plans change then tell me. Don't leave me hanging. It's not that hard.

But now I'm mostly giving up on dating. Sleep is wayyy more important. I don't know how I'd survive with 4-6 hours of sleep a night in high school. Now I want 10+ hours no matter what kind of day I'm having.

###Summer

Hopefully I'll get some time to myself in these next few weeks. I find it so much easier to get up in the morning when there are no people/parentals around. I just want to be alone and do my thing. I mean, my dream home is a one-bedroom apartment that I don't have to share with anybody else.

Damn, when did I get so good at typing?

My left shoulder has been getting a nice, golden tan from spending an hour+ in direct sunlight on the 405 every day. If only I could do the same to my right shoulder. I've even been taking off my Fitbit to try to get rid of the tan line on my wrist. It's uncomfortable trying to drive with my right wrist in direct sunlight.

I'm a little sad that I probably won't have time to enjoy the beach and other young people things this summer since I'll be spending my life working and commuting and sleeping. And this is supposed to be just a taste of adult life. I don't know if I want to do this for the next 40 years. I'd much rather sleep.

Not "this" as in software development. That part's great. "This" as in a grown-up full-time job situation.

I probably just need to adjust. I'll get used to it. I've adapted before.
