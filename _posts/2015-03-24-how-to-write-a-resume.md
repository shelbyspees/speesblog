I'm so sick of seeing crappy resumes.

It's ridiculous. Talented people are completely underselling themselves with their weak bullets and off-centered formatting.

It's time for that to change. I'm introducing a resume formula that anyone can implement to improve their job hunting effectiveness. It's geared mostly toward people in technical fields, but I hope anyone can pull something useful out of my explanations.

The most important thing to remember about resumes is this:

***The resume and cover letter are to get you an interview.  
The interview is to get you the job.***

>[Skills](#skills)

>[Don't include](#dont-include)  
>[Examples](#examples)

<h2 class="" id="header">Header</h2>

The header should always contain the following:

- First and last name
- Desired job title, if applicable
- Phone number
- Email

If you have the following, include it:

- Website/landing page/LinkedIn profile
- Portfolio/GitHub

Do not include:

- Home address
- Mailing address

>**First Last:** Full-Stack Rails Engineer  
>firstlast@email.com   
>(999) 999-9999   
>firstlast.github.io [OR] linkedin.com/in/firstlast

<h2 class="" id="objective"><s>Objective</s></h2>

<s>Objective: To obtain a position in which I can utilize my skills...</s>

No. Stop. Don't include an objective. Instead, write a [great cover letter]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-03-15-how-to-cover-letter %}
).

You may come across a situation where it makes sense to include a summary. That's different.

<h2 class="" id="summary">Summary</h2>

Include:

- **Simple description of your current situation**
	- "Third-year computer science student"
	- "Full-stack LAMP developer"
	- "Software architect with 15 years of experience"
- **Most important skills (if not clear from above)**
	- "Android application development"
	- "AngularJS and NodeJS"
	- "automated testing in Ruby"
- **"seeking"**
- **Kind of job you're looking for**
	- "Software Developer Intern position"
- **Locations you're interested in**
	- "in the greater Los Angeles area."
- **Dates and Availability**
	- "Available from May 1st, 2015."

Those last two points are the main reason why you'd include a summary, as opposed to not putting anything, since most of the time your resume will be sent in response to a particular job posting. If you're posting your resume on a job board for recruiters to come find you, the summary will help them match positions to your needs.

>Third-year computer science student experienced with Android application development seeking Software Developer Intern position for summer 2015 in the greater Los Angeles area. Available full-time from May 1st.

If you're a student or recent graduate (<1 year after graduation), education goes next. Otherwise experience goes next.

<h2 class="" id="education">Education</h2>

Order of importance:

1. **Degree and major**
2. **Graduation date**
3. **School** (only include city and state if not obvious from school name)
	- "University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA" is redundant and a waste of space
4. **GPA**
5. Minors and emphases, if applicable

>**Bachelor of Science, Computer Science**, December 2016 (expected)  
>University of XYZ, City, ST  
>GPA: 3.65

>**Bachelor of Arts, Linguistics** (Japanese Emphasis), June 2012  
>University of California, Santa Barbara  
>GPA: 3.48  
><s>Minor in Education</s> (I leave this off nowadays since I have two degrees to fit in)

<h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>

Definitely the most important section of your resume. Don't screw this up.

Order of importance:

1. **Job title**
2. **Start and end dates** (Month, Year)
3. **Company**, City, ST
4. **Job description**

But don't think the job description is unimportant. It's all about accomplishments.

Most job-seekers make the mistake of listing the duties required of them at their previous positions. This isn't what will make you stand out to employers. It doesn't matter if you're applying to mop floors--when an hiring manager has a stack of resumes in front of them, you want to use any tools you have at your disposal to get them to say, "Hmm, yes, this person sounds good." Don't make them think. Do the thinking for them.

Here's the anatomy of a job description bullet:

- **[Verb]-ed** -- Each line item should start with an active verb in the simple past. This has the added benefit of maintaining parallelism, which is both morphologically pleasing and easier to mentally parse. Some good examples:
	- Achieved
	- Implemented
	- Designed
	- Presented
	- Improved
	- Trained/Mentored
	- Managed
	- Created
	- Influenced
	- Increased/Decreased
	- Negotiated
	- Launched
- **Specific action** -- closely tied to above
- **Technical buzzword**
	- Languages
	- Frameworks
	- Parts of application
- **Quantified benefit of action**
	- "Under budget"
	- Percentages
	- Number of people
	- Dollar amounts
	- Time reduction

Check out this example bullet:

>- Refactored middle-tier codebase to remove repetition and redundancy, reducing average bug-fix time by 75%

(I didn't remove the alliteration though. I don't recommend including alliteration on your resume, it's distracting.)

####Things to avoid:

- **Unprovable soft skill buzzwords**
	- Best of breed
	- Go-getter
	- Think outside of the box
	- Synergy
	- Go-to person
	- Results-driven
	- Team player
	- Hard worker
	- Strategic thinker
	- Detail-oriented
- **Job duties that could be taken for granted**
	- Fixing bugs, writing documentation, greeting customers
	- Everything needs to be explained in terms of its benefit to the business








<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>

This section is usually geared more toward students and new grads, since experienced professionals will have actual applicable experience to discuss in the section above. Projects are also a great way to show off your personality and interests. 

>Project Name - Simple Description, Dates  
>
>- Bullet  
>- Bullet

Bullets should be similar to those under Experience but probably shorter and with more name-dropping of technologies.

For example:

>**substitutions.io** - News Article Aggregator, March 2015 to present   
>
>- Deployed content aggregator website using Rails and AngularJS  
>- Used regular expressions to find-and-replace common phrases with jokes  
>- Based on XKCD comic #1288







<h2 class="" id="skills">Skills</h2>

I usually do this section in a table of some sort. This way it's easy to line things up vertically.

**Disclaimer: Not claiming to possess any of these skills. This list is for illustrative purposes only.

| Skills |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| Languages: | Ruby, Python, JavaScript, Java |
| Tools: | AngularJS, NodeJS |
|       | Spring Tool Suite, Eclipse, Visual Studio |
|       | Apache TomCat |
|       | Git, Microsoft Team Foundation Server |
| Other: | French, Japanese, Spanish | 
| 		 | Copy editing, proofreading, blogging | 







<h2 class="" id="dont-include">Don't Include</h2>

- Objective
- "References available upon request"
	- If they want references, they'll ask for references whether or not you decide to waste space on your resume stating this
- Physical address
	- Traditional small businesses might care about this, but most large companies (especially technology companies) won't. They're not going to send you snail-mail. The space is better off being used for something else.
- Hobbies/Other interests
	- Just listing your hobbies is pointless. There's no way to prove how often you practice karate or play guitar. If you're really interested in something, make it into a neat project.
- A second page
	- If [Gayle Laakmann McDowell](http://www.gayle.com/resume/) can fit all of her killer experience on one page, so can you.







<h2 class="" id="examples">Examples</h2>

This first example helped me get the interview for my first internship. I wrote it about three months after I started my CS degree. I had a lot of cool experience that totally didn't relate to the positions I was applying for, so I made a section called "Activities" where I briefly summarized each one. Basically, it showed that I'd been busy.

This next resume, along with a heartfelt cover letter, got me to the first round of the Google Speech Evaluator application last summer for which I got to take a neat phonetic transcription test. I think I took too long on the test, but the hiring manager was really nice.

<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/files/june.png"/>

This is my most recent resume. I still don't have any useful skills or decent projects, but at least it's readable.

<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/files/march.png"/>









<h2 class="" id="format">Format</h2>

Here's an example of how to use tables to improve resume format. Note that the content here can use a lot more detail, and I changed some of the wording to anonymize this example so it might not make perfect sense.
