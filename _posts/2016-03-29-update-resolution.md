Three months into the year and I'm thinking about what's changed--and what hasn't. CW: mental illness, self-harm.

I'm doing way better than I was before my doctor increased my antidepressant dose. I'm not thinking about death (my own) every day. I'm not imagining all the ways I could end things. I never had a plan, but suicidal ideation is never not scary. Especially, ESPECIALLY when your life is as lucky and positive as mine is. I have every reason to stick around.

I don't think I've ever hit the point where I need to be hospitalized. But I will hit that point someday. I'm almost looking forward to it. At least then I'll have medical evidence of my problems. Occasional therapy doesnâ€™t stand up to scrutiny as well as inpatient psychiatric care.

Why would I make this up? I have everything to lose and nothing to gain. No, I'm like the marathon runner who has a heart attack. Despite everyone's expectations, my heath fails me.

My new year's resolution fell totally flat. There's no way looking in the mirror and saying "I love you" would have had any significant effect without pharmalogical adjustments. 

It's not a bad idea for the neurotypical to try self-love as a remedy for confidence issues. On the other hand, someone like me with a long history of clinical depression and other undesirable brain chemistry will need treatment that's a bit more direct.

Still working with my doctor and therapist about the ADHD test results. It's hard not to seem like a drug-seeker, since I work in an intellectually demanding job. Plus I'm already prone to addictive/compulsive behavior. I understand any doctor's hesitation to prescribe stimulants for someone like me. 

But ADHD is spot on as a diagnosis. It feels like my brain gets in the way of my ability to think. I just want to shut off my brain so I can work and get shit done when I need to. Ugh.

I've developed some seriously quality coping mechanisms over the years so I've had a lot of success thus far. Still, as my life gets more complicated I'm going to drop the ball more and more, which will in turn make me more depressed, which will in turn make it harder for me to keep my life together. 

And this isn't new. I've always had problems with my train of thought, memory, concentration. Now I can stop thinking I'm an idiot or I have early onset Alzheimer's or I was dropped on my head as a baby. I mean, it might be from the 5 or so years of mild lead exposure. Apparently that has a causal link with ADHD. But environmental factors only play a role when you're genetically predisposed. I'd love to find some DNA evidence of ADHD in me but I'm not sure if that's feasible.

Anyway, having reduced the amount of paralyzing thoughts going through my head, I now have space in my life for things like exercise. It's been shown that quality diet and exercise have similar effects on the brain to antidepressant medication like Prozac. 

I wish it were easy to exercise when I'm in a bad place. When I'm down like that it's hard to do anything besides curl up in a ball. Let me describe how it feels:

My gut feels like it's been punched, but it also feels this anticipatory emptiness like it should be or is about to be stabbed. My skin crawls: arms, shoulders, knees, feet. My hands shake and the skin on my forearms tingles and I want to scratch it off. I want to throw up, but I'm not nauseous. It also feels like the atmosphere is pressing down on my body and slowly crushing me. My movements and speech are slowed like I'm made of molasses.

That's before I start crying. I've noticed that people being unexpectedly nice will often make me cry ("We saved you a seat"). Talking about my depression also makes me cry. Talking about it makes it real.

If I'm crying, I'm sobbing. I feel like I'm being sucked dry. I want to tear things apart: a pillow, my hair, my skin. The atmospheric crushing gets heavier. My day is gone, lost, ruined. The generic self-hate turns into pointed loathing and disgust. I'm sobbing, hard, for an hour or more. I feel so lonely I could die. My stomach feels like a black hole. The despair I felt every day for two months in Bordeaux rears its ugly head. Just so much darkness inside.

With the antidepressants I'm currently on, I get all the dysfunctional with almost none of the sad. Which makes me feel like I'm even crazier. How can I be this calm when my life is falling apart around me? 

It's this dissonant calm, like the eye of a hurricane. Not that I know shit about hurricanes. But I'm anticipating the imminent destruction. I know it's coming. Somehow, I want it. I want my life to fall apart.

Self-destructive behavior like addiction, self-harm, eating disorders I think comes from a desire to match one's external circumstances with the reality of their feelings.

I've done the motionless-until-life-falls-apart rodeo a couple times. There's no scared straight. There's no wake up call. There's only rock bottom, and it's a long way down.
