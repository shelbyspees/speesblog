title: Do you consider yourself a good person?

What is a good person? Everybody is multi-faceted, everyone has good behavior and bad behavior. 

My moral compass is somewhere along the lines of, "Do no harm." But I break this on a daily basis.

How much harm do I do when I drive to work instead of riding my bike? How bad is it when I eat normal meat instead of buying it from a local, sustainable, free-range sources? What about the plastic cup I just threw out, or the extra-long shower I took earlier?

Does it make me a good person to feel this kind of guilt?

I also think I'm not a good person because I don't participate in activism toward causes I care about. I'm a feminist, an urbanist, an educator, an environmentalist. I care about socioeconomic issues that may or may not directly affect me. What have I done lately to improve the lives of people of color? Or the poor?

Would it have made me a good person to give money to that homeless man with a cardboard sign when I was waiting to turn on Venice and Sawtelle the other day? I didn't because I didn't want him to use it to buy drugs.

Am I a bad person because I forgot to vote? Am I a good person because I try to vote with my dollars? Am I a bad person from buying clothes from cheap retailers like Forever21 and H&M that abuse the rights of garment workers? What about the MacBook Pro that I'm typing on? Some of its parts were built by someone in terrible working conditions as well.

No, I am not a good person. But I am better than many people out there.
