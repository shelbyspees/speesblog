I just tweeted about the various careers I've had.

The past six months or so I've been really struggling. Moving back home and losing my independence was a huge blow to my ego. It's absolutely a necessary sacrifice in order to set myself up for the next chapter in my life, but I hated losing the autonomy I had gotten so used to.

I dreamed of an office job. I wanted approval, and people don't approve of working food service jobs while living at home. My cute wardrobe was gathering dust while I tread sawdust onto my carpet and frantically tried to rub the deodorant streaks off my black work polo before my shift.

And I was bored. I couldn't connect the dots among what I'd been learning on my own, but nothing was challenging. I had no direction. As I've said a few times recently, I only felt I had a sense of purpose while carrying pizza to customers' tables.

I knew I had potential, but I had no context. No peer pressure. No outside goal. It's perfectly normal to lack motivation in such an environment. I felt like a loser and that nothing would change. 

Luckily, it can. I just started an internship at a local software company this past Monday. Finally I feel like a contributing member of society. I have no idea what's going on and I feel completely useless, but I have an opportunity to learn. I have structure. I need that.
