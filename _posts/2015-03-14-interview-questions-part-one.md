I answer interview questions for fun anyway, so I might as well make some posts with them.

***What is the best decision you ever made? How did you make it?***

[Answered]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-03-14-the-best-decision %}) in another post, although I'm not sure I'd say it in an interview.

***What is your greatest weakness?***

[Answered]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2014-10-18-biggest-weakness %}) in a very introspective, not-quite-professional way. I'll probably update my answer at some point.

***Where do you see yourself in five years time?***

I want to be a software engineer at a small- to mid-sized software company, where software is the profit center. I'm not sure if I'll be living in the Bay Area, NYC, or the Pacific Northwest, but I imagine I'd enjoy living in any of those areas since each of them has a good number of young people and a strong tech scene. My lifestyle should include great food, beer, yoga, gym, and a job I love. I'm holding my breath for that one-bedroom apartment, and I definitely want to commute via public transit.

Although I don't always imagine myself in a leadership role, I think as I build my technical skills and become involved in some interesting projects I'll start shouldering some leadership responsibilities. I definitely want to have ownership over some aspect of the product, and I want to be considered a subject-matter expert in whatever I'm specializing in when I get there.

I'm not sure at what point I'll be experienced enough to make architecture decisions, but that's definitely something I want to do someday. My current team lead was brought on because of his architecture design expertise, and I really admire that about him. 

I also want to get involved in the open source community. I'd like to be known as a consistent contributor to the people working those projects. Open source work is actually really great for me because I care more about quality and process than about profit. I'm also a big fan of sharing my ideas publicly and building an online presence, as evidenced by this blog. Plus I think I can learn a lot about best practices from the more successful open source projects out there.

***Tell me about a time when you demonstrated good oral communication skills.***

Sometimes in a meeting or another group setting, when one person is trying to ask a question or make a point and I can sense that the other person isn't quite understanding it, I'll try to gently clarify for both parties. It looks kind of like this:

*Correct me if I'm misunderstanding this, but I think [speaker] is asking about how XYZ will blah blah.*

And the times I've said things like this, often [speaker] will say something like, "Yes, Shelby said exactly what I'm trying to say."

This happens especially with non-native English speakers, of which we have several on my team. They're very smart people who generally communicate very well, but since I have a lot of experience reading between the lines with English learners I have this urge to make sure their ideas are heard.

I usually wait until I'm pretty confident that I understand where both people are coming from. I'm lucky that I've been included in meetings and other conversations such that I feel comfortable contributing my thoughts.

I first noticed this skill when tutoring my classmates in my French and Japanese classes. I'd hear the teacher's grammar explanation, give myself a minute to understand it, and then explain it to my classmates a little bit differently. My French 3 teacher in high school would have me take individual students outside when they were struggling and give them grammar explanations during class time. I remember one of my Japanese teachers complimenting my analogies on multiple occasions. My classmate told me I should write the next edition of the textbook.

In my current role, I find it really useful to rephrase or break down difficult topics to verify my understanding of them, like when our database guy went through how he manages the data types and attributes in the system we're writing a web app for. If this has a side effect of helping other people in the room understand the topic, all the better.

One thing I think helps me a lot is after living abroad in countries where I wasn't fluent in the language, I've gotten over the need to sound smart all the time. Sometimes you just need to communicate, and if you hesistate to open your mouth because you're worried you don't have all the right vocabulary, you're going to waste a lot of time.

I'm actually pretty terrible with vocabulary. I tell myself I have mild aphasia, but it's completely undiagnosed. I forget words all the time, and it's been getting worse since high school. Very rarely I'll say the exact right word I'm looking for in the sentence where I'm trying to say it without having to grope for it. It feels like finding hidden treasure.

I find that reading a lot helps my vocabulary, and actually reading fiction helps it the most. That's probably because I'm really picky about my fiction, which means when I do bother to read fiction I don't put it down until I'm completely finished. It's like a vocabulary binge. It's great.
