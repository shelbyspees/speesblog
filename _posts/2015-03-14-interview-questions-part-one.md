I answer interview questions for fun anyway, so I might as well make some posts with them.

####What do you consider to be your greatest achievement to date?


####Where do you see yourself in five years time?

####Think about a time when you worked as part of a successful team. What was your specific role in this team and what was achieved?

####Give me a specific example of something you did that helped build enthusiasm in others.

####How do you determine priorities in scheduling your time? Give examples.




####Describe a task that you completed that you didnâ€™t enjoy. How did you motivate yourself?
