Writing is cathartic. Wine facilitates writing.

I love being home alone. Being around people, even around those who love me the most, is mildly draining. I get energy from being alone.

While I'm definitely a lot more social and outgoing (and probably obnoxious) than I was 5+ years ago, I find that a solo mini-vacation can be refreshing. This is especially true since I've been living in a fairly noisy household for the past 14ish months.

People who don't understand introversion can't really get why we introverts would want so much time alone. Does it mean we don't love them? Does it mean we want to run away and never see them again? No, not at all.

Think of it like your favorite ice cream flavor. Rich, sweet, wonderfully delicious. Some people can eat it every day, while others prefer it in small doses. I'm a small doses kind of person. It's much tastier when I've had time to build up a little anticipation.

(There are other unrelated issues with ice cream in my life. It worked best for my metaphor here. Don't read too much into it.)

The point is I'm alone with some lovely animals right now and I'm very happy about it. Rather than being annoyed by background noise or the voices of TV reporters, I can be annoyed by the styling on the new section of my blog I'm trying to set up.
