ADHD treatment makes me no longer hate myself.

I started my ADHD medication last month in May, and it was like black and white. I could think about work for longer than 15 minutes straight? Is this how other people are all the time?

My impulsiveness was almost completely gone. I wasn't spending hundreds of dollars a week on shit I didn't need. Yes, I will readily admit to my irresponsible behavior. I have to keep reminding myself: it's a symptom.

I couldn't tackle these problems on my own no matter how hard I tried. And I tried.

## Willpower

Focusing on willpower ***wasn't working.***

My brain activity is just *different* and I don't have control over that. 

Sure, I have really powerful coping mechanisms. I've had to develop them to reach the success I've been able to reach. I won't lie, I've done a lot compared to most 25 year olds. I've been very fortunate and I've also hustled.

But throughout my entire life, people have seen my potential and known that I wasn't reaching it. So much feedback from teachers, friends, family, my parents: "Stop procrastinating" and "You're not an A student" and "Why don't you just do the work?"

The world told me I wasn't applying myself. I felt lazy and stupid and stuck.

## History lesson

It turns out that I'm not lazy. I'm not stupid. Again--I remind myself)--my brain is *different*.

My irresponsible shopping, eating, TV watching, and other compulsive habits were a reaction. I was being actively self-destructive in response to a lifetime of feeling lazy and stupid and stuck.

<aside>
  <p>Side note: At this point I'm going to propose once again that "lazy" be considered an ableist slur. It's too often used to blame people for circumstances they have no power to improve. Using the word "lazy" to describe people is intellectually lazy (maybe someday I'll write a post about ableism and intellectal laziness).</p>
  <p>Like with all ableist slurs, I challenge you to reconsider what you're trying to say about a person when "lazy" is the word that comes to mind.</p>
</aside>

My struggle to focus and be productive--consistent since first grade--became unbearable when I landed the job and life I've always dreamed of. Everything was falling into place, but for some reason I STILL couldn't get things done.

I asked myself:

> *I love this work. I love this job. I love this life. It's everything I ever wanted. Why is it so hard???*

It was hard because had so little control over my brain that it made me hate myself. I knew logically what needed to happen but I still didn't do it. I'd remind myself of the terrible consequences of not doing the thing while not doing it and nothing changed, I still wouldn't do it.

I'd twist my own arm and open the textbook or IDE or Word document and stare at it for 20 or 40 minutes with just white noise as thoughts.

All through elementary school and middle school I needed extensions on essays and projects. For timed writes I'd turn in blank pieces of paper with just my name and the ever-changing date at the top and a few spots where my tears had fallen on the page. Maybe I'd get in a weak, messy sentence or two.

Why did nobody suspect a learning disability? I guess things were different in the 90s and early 2000s. I was gifted so obviously I couldn't have a learning disability. I did well on tests so I just needed to apply myself for work like projects and essays. It just takes willpower.

I always got the advice.

> Start working on it earlier before the due date.  
> Make an outline.  
> Schedule time in your day to study.  
> Make a to-do list.  
> Use the pomodoro method.  
> Give yourself breaks.  
> Give yourself rewards.  
> Just force yourself to get the work done.

I read all the self-improvement books and motivational websites I could get my hands on.

Why couldn't I be like a Sim? Put tasks on my calendar and I just do them. Whenever I put things on my calendar I'd feel increasingly guilty as time slipped by and nothing happened. I'd get depressed, which was counterproductive.

There were periods when the advice worked, and over the years I developed amazing coping mechanisms and accomplished some really cool things.

But I could never scratch the underlying problem--a problem I knew was there but couldn't identify. Since I couldn't identify it, I had no way to solve it. I was stuck.

## Self-hate

More and more I felt like I was losing grip on my life. The wall I hit in 2010 in Bordeaux was the first time in my life I truly felt helpless.

Feeling helpless made me feel worthless. If I can't take charge of my own stupid brain for school, how was I going to accomplish anything in life? How will I ever have a career? I can't keep this up forever.

On top of feeling worthless, I felt like a crazy person. Why was it so easy for other people and so hard for me?

I always believed in mind over matter. That with the right attitude I can accomplish anything. I knew logically what I needed to do, and I knew logically that I was able to do it all. But for some reason it wasn't happening.

I started gaslighting myself, which spiraled me into my first severe depressed episode.

> *I'm imagining things, there's nothing really wrong with me. I'm just being lazy. I just need to get on top of my shit.*

Even though I was crying for six hours a day for two months, I scoffed when my host mom suggested I was depressed.

> *No, I just need to get my act together. I'm perfectly capable of handling everything on my plate.*

That's gaslighting.

Fast forward to 2015. My life magically fell into place when I got my amazing job and apartment. Everything was going right, I knew I was supposed to be happy. But I still felt terrible all the time.

> *I shouldn't be depressed, why am I depressed? I know what work I need to do, why aren't I getting it done? I like this work! Why can't I think? What's wrong with me?*

Getting out of bed every day felt like death. It took me at least two hours to be able to accomplish anything productive in the mornings. I've never been a morning person but this was the worst it's ever been.

Casual conversation was hard. I had good ideas but I had so much trouble expressing them. It was impossible for me to tell stories without getting sidetracked or skipping around, which is pretty confusing to listen to. I could only tell a story straight through after rehearsing it a dozen times or writing the entire thing down.

My social confidence was shot. I've always thought I was just terrible at telling stories.

I consistently struggled to make my point in discussions. This has always been the case, actually. I gave up expressing my opinions long ago. Even when I became more confident in my ideas, I failed to get my point across. It's common to interrupt a conversation partner, but I couldn't recover from conversational interruptions the way others could.

My brain was a paradox. I knew I was smart but I never sounded smart. I couldn't share my ideas even I knew I was right.

I'm a great teacher and I can explain things well, but unless it was something I'd taught many times before or rehearsed I'd still get stuck mid-sentence.

Last year I got new reading glasses because I was struggling to read for school. Even though I had no problem reading novels or twitter or text messages, textbooks and software docs were blurry. I'd read the same sentence 20 times without making sense of it. I'd get to the bottom of a page and realize I didn't retain any of what I just read.

The glasses didn't make a difference. I thought my eyes were causing the blurriness, but really it was my brain that was blurry.

All of these are *classic* symptoms of ADHD, but it was completely off my radar. 

I was still struggling in spite of my blessed circumstances. Once again I felt helpless, which once again made me feel worthless.

I wanted control over something, anything. So I'd purposely act irresponsibly.

When mental health professionals describe anorexia, OCD, and other mental illness, they stress that the behavior associated with these illnesses is about control. 

Mentally ill people often find illogical ways to feel like they have control over their illogical world ([1](http://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/counsellor-articles/when-the-sun-breaks-down-eating-disorders-and-the-issue-of-control), [2](http://psychcentral.com/lib/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-and-uncertainty/), see also: [poverty brain](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/11/your-brain-on-poverty-why-poor-people-seem-to-make-bad-decisions/281780/)).

I indulged every day. Clothes and makeup I didn't need. Dining out when I could have cooked at home. Four or five pints of ice cream a week. I gained thirty pounds between February 2015 and February 2016. Half of those pounds happened in December and January.

My self-preservation instinct was gone. I'd gotten so depressed that by January and February I was thinking about being dead pretty much all the time.

I wasn't planning anything. I understood logically that these thoughts are scary. I made sure to reach out to Becca and Minna when I felt especially bad.

<aside>
  <p>Seriously, Becca and Minna have been so relentlessly wonderful the past three-plus years. I absolutely would not be where I am today without their all-day-every-day love and support, especially via text. I honestly feel like they've saved my life countless times. I'll never be able to repay them for that.</p>
  <p>To those who didn't know I was doing this poorly, that's how I wanted it. I felt like a burden and I didn't want to weigh you down with my negativity. Thank you for being wonderful anyway. If you're reading this, I truly value your presence in my life.</p>
  <p>Here's the gist: I honestly hated myself so much, and I thought everyone else hated me and nobody actually wanted me around. Depression warps how you see reality. There were entire days when I just couldn't talk to people because I was convinced they hated me and I'd ruin things with my presence. If I've ever flaked on you, that's probably what was going through my head. Anything you told me otherwise wouldn't have changed my mind.</p>
  <p>I'm actually crying right now writing this. It's therapeutic to share what I was going through but it's also incredibly painful to think about all the time and opportunities I've lost over the past six years. I'm trying to focus on how much closer I am to reaching my potential now that I have treatment that's helping, but I can't ignore the lost time. But I also don't feel the despair and hopelessness I would have felt six months ago. It's much easier to be reasonable now.</p>
  <p>Thank you for reading this.</p>
</aside>

But honestly, I just didn't want to be around anymore. I went through the motions to avoid hurting people or inconveniencing people too much.

I knew logically that I have potential to do great things, but I felt stuck and powerless. I knew logically that I'm likeable and fun and wonderful to be around and that people love me, but I just hated myself. I felt like the good things in my life were wasted on me.

Last year, Becca asked me why I hate myself so much. I didn't know how to answer the question. 

> *Does there need to be a reason? I've always hated myself. That's just my natural orientation. Wasn't it the human condition to hate oneself?*
>
>*I mean, I'm a little extreme because I'm genetically predisposed to severe depression. But I'm far from the only person who thinks like this. It's the happy people who are the weird ones.*

No, Shelby, they're not the weird ones.

## Treatment

Over the past year I've wished that I could "turn off my brain so I can just *think*!"

When I started ADHD treatment, that's exactly what happened.

No more background thoughts. No more constant stream of *I hate myself I hate myself I hate myself*.

I had control over my thoughts for the first time ever. Background noise and conversation didn't bother me. I could be productive without waiting for the stars to align and performing mystical incantations.

I even stopped being tired all the time. Instead of 4-6 hours of productivity in a day, I had like, 12 hours.

Apparently it's common for people with ADHD to feel tired all the time because we're constantly fighting with our brain activity to be able to focus. Turning off the background noise means I only have to spend energy thinking about what I want to think about. Now I burn through my daily supply of energy much more slowly. Seriously, it lasts *forever*.

(I find it helpful to think of energy as a currency, which makes sense if you know about [the differences between introversion and extraversion.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion#Extraversion))

Suddenly--SO SUDDENLY--I was getting things done. I was starting and finishing tasks in a single sitting.

I was STOKED.

I could finally be good at this amazing job I have. I already loved my job but it was so frustrating not being as productive as I knew I could be.

Now when I read technical books and articles, I just absorb it all the first time. Like, what? I already knew I loved thinking about this stuff but you mean to tell me I can just learn it? Just like that? I don't have to fight with it for months and months before it clicks?

This whole time at my amazing job, I could see my potential sitting there on the top shelf. I was straining and figuratively dislocating my shoulder trying to reach it. The medication feels like a step stool. My potential is right there and now I can reach it without even trying.

## It's so easy now

I can think about doing something and I just do it. I can sit down to write an email or a blog post and I finish writing it. Time goes by so fast and I'm getting so many things done and I'm really really happy.

I don't get to work at 9:30 and crash at 3:30, no longer able to accomplish anything. I really don't crash at all anymore. I've worked so many 12 hour days in the past month. Now, I shouldn't want to work 12 hour days. It's not healthy or sustainable. My managers don't know that I've been working that much.

I'm playing catch-up after the past year of daily struggling, so being productive at work is really refreshing. It makes me happy. I'm choosing to spend that energy on work, but going forward I can spend it on anything. Cooking, exercise, school, personal projects, socializing, reading, blogging, fiction writing.

You know how I said I think of energy as a currency? My ADHD meds make me feel like I won the lottery.

<aside>
  <p>Now that I think about it, that's probably why I really don't feel that strongly about making a lot of money or being rich. I want to be comfortable and have a certain amount of financial freedom, but I don't give a shit about the salary dick-measuring contests.</p>
  <p>If this is common among women, it could be argued that that's partially why we still have a pay gap. But institutionalized sexism is still a thing and I think I'll just put a pin in this enormous tangent.</p>
  <p>I'm far from the first person to assert that one's health, energy, and time are more valuable than income or net worth.</p>
</aside>

I have energy now. I have time. I have control. I almost don't even think about hating myself anymore.

My poor productivity wasn't a willpower issue. I couldn't just suck it up and get the work done. Thinking I could and that it was my fault I was failing was what made me hate myself so much.

I'm still clearing old things off my plate for work and for school. The echo of self-hate returns when I remember I still have to do that thing that I wanted to do six months ago and I'm still disappointing people. I'll finish it! I know I can now! Treatment is helping! But telling these people about my health problems will sound like I'm making excuses.

At some point I may show this blog post to the folks I feel like I'm disappointing. Probably once I clean up my backlog and finish the work. I do want them to understand why I've been so flaky this whole time.

But if I tell them before I finish the task they might just relieve me of it. I still need these small wins to feel confident in my abilities, and I don't want a reputation of needing my hand held.

I just want these people to understand that my flakiness was temporary and I don't anticipate having these problems in the future. I want to work, I want to do a good job, and I'm doing a lot better now with treatment.

Last year it felt like my material life fell into place with the car and job and apartment. It seems that now my mental health is falling into place with the treatment and confidence and social life.

It's funny. I'm usually so scared I'll jinx myself saying positive things like that.

Now that my brain seems to be working right for the first time ever, it's much easier think positively about the future. I don't need brace myself for disappointment. I don't have to hate myself.
