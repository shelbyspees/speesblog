I'm so tired but I can't turn off my brain.

This time last year I was obsessing over [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](http://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Anniversary-ebook/dp/B00GOZV3TM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1413354191&sr=8-1&keywords=7+habits+of+highly+effective+people).

My first attempt at reading this book was back in 2009. It felt super weird and religious to me at the time. I wonder what changed.

I'm not at all a religious person. I'd barely categorize myself as spiritual. But one belief I do hold dear is in my capacity to improve. That, and the idea that most people aren't evil. Those two beliefs keep me going.

I definitely go through phases when I'm super on it with the habits and then I fall apart. The first habit is really the key. Being proactive. 

I need to spend less time thinking and more time doing. And while this type of blogging is a natural progression of my eight years of journaling, and it's a great way to introspect while also improving my writing and typing, it's not exactly what I should be doing today.
