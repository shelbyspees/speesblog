We got a puppy. Daisy. She's amazing.

And I realized that she's the perfect study buddy. She relaxes me when I'm stressed about school. She chews on my hand while I'm watching my lectures. She's just wiggly enough to keep my attention without distracting me too much from the content. It's great since I can't speed up my lectures for two of my classes.

She's a companion. I needed that.

It's so obvious too. People always talk about owning a pet to help them relax. How taking care of someone else helps them feel more responsible. You look forward to having someone to come home to. Someone who loves you. Someone with such simple needs, and so few problems.

Pets are used all over for therapeutic purposes. Tons of research there. We even had like a dog day on the Wednesday of dead week at UCSB. It was my favorite day all quarter.

I can already tell that she's really happy here. Delta took some time to warm up to her, though. Lots of growling the first day. Since then, however, her jealousy has tranformed into tolerance, and that's quickly turning into friendship. Maybe in a few weeks we'll see something like love.

I, on the other hand, am smitten. Oh man. I could just spend all day cuddling her and playing with her and getting my hands chewed up by her. I've even been analyzing my schedule to figure out if I'd be available to watch her when my parents are at work.

Daisy kind of lets me play the maternal role. A bit. It feels good. Hopefully she'll help me hold off that urge for a few more years/decades.
