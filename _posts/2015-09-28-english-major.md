Lately I've been on a learning spree. Nonfiction advice writing has kind of worn itself out though. It doesn't seem that there's much left to learn from the self-improvement genre at this point. I'll only improve by applying those lessons.

So I turned to fiction, as I mentioned in an [earlier post]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-06-26-writing %}). I started with [Stephen King's *On Writing*](http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Memoir-Craft/dp/B0000547HM/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1448181059&sr=8-1), went through [Sol Stein's *Stein on Writing*](http://www.amazon.com/Stein-Writing-Master-Techniques-Strategies/dp/B0002P0DAK/ref=mt_audio_download?_encoding=UTF8&me=), and now I'm in the middle of [The Great Courses' *Writing Great Fiction: Storytelling Tips and Techniques*](http://www.audible.com/pd/Self-Development/Writing-Great-Fiction-Storytelling-Tips-and-Techniques-Audiobook/B00P026PZC). Highly recommend all three of these audiobooks for anyone who likes reading fiction and has an interest in English language style and usage. Even as a reader they were enlightening.

The Great Courses lecture series on *Writing Great Fiction* is presented by novelist James Hynes, who has also worked as a writing professor. Hynes gives quite a few reading recommendations (and spoils quite a few books in his lectures) and after hearing his analysis I decided to try reading these books and looking for the details he described.

One thing is certain, I'm a much better reader now that I was in 11th grade English class. I think now I'm trying to undo the torment I put myself through in my attempt to succeed in that class.

AP English Lang was great for me. It was one of the catalysts that pushed me onto the path of becoming a decent academic writer. I also ruthlessly compared myself to my classmates. I won't go into detail about my teenage angst but basically I cried a lot that year.

So I hated English classes, I hated analyzing literature. I just wanted to read it.

It wasn't until my delicate disposition was insulted and assaulted by some really terrible fiction writing earlier this year---by someone who considers themselves a professional---that I realized I can do a lot better.

This is all old news. I'm at the point where I feel I can learn what English majors learn. I can read and understand and analyze and criticize great literature. I can learn from the classics and the modern greats.

The problem with being a new writer, though, is that your tastes are always going to be more refined than your skills.

If I practice, if I write every day, I have no doubt I'll get good eventually. That's what the past few years have taught me. No amount of reading replaces just banging your head against the wall until it breaks (the wall, hopefully).

But I'm not in a hurry to write. There's no pressure. Churning out those first million crap words will make things easier further along the line, but it won't kill me to read and think for a couple years before I put pen to paper.

This is a hobby. A reading list will hurt more than it helps. I have enough I want to start and even more stuff I've started that I want to finish.

But it's nice knowing if I did take some English lit classes now, I wouldn't do too poorly.
