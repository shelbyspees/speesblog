title: "The Best Decision I Ever Made"

I wonder if my response to this question would fly in an interview.

Cutting my hair short has been the best single decision I ever made. Anyone who knows me has heard it a dozen times. Better than going to college, better than picking up the violin, better than learning French or Japanese--mostly because those were less decisions and more opportunities. But cutting my hair, that was a decision. Such a stupid change, but it's had such a huge impact on my confidence. 

I always envied boys growing up. They didn't have to worry about how their hair looked every day. They could run and play and move around without dark strands of dead skin cells flying into their eyes or sticking to their chapstick. From the age of 10 I knew I wanted to go boy-short. My mom never let me.

My long, thick hair didn't cooperate no matter what I did. When I hit puberty, it decided to turn frizzy and wavy. If I tried blow-drying it, I'd look like this (but you know, significantly less confident. And with horrible skin):

In 11th grade I'd wake up at 4:45am every day to shower, blow dry, flat iron, get dressed, do makeup, and then leave for school at 6:30am. I have no idea how I took seven APs in high school and graduated with a 3.92 GPA while doing all of this. Plus I was concertmaster of two orchestras, like a crazy woman. (Okay, yeah, humblebrag.)

In 12th grade I switched to wearing it wavy/curly, but it would take six different products to keep it looking decent all day. I tried everything on the market, and luckily I had my mom to subsidize my investments in the beauty industry. The amount of money she must have spent... I can't even fathom.

I dreaded any occasion where I'd be expected to look remotely nice. Blow drying or straightening it right out of the shower would make me sweat, which would cause my hair to frizz up and completely reverse all the hard work it took to make it look good. 

In school I wore it in a ponytail or a bun every day. If I tried wearing it down for some reason, it'd be back up in a ponytail within the hour. No matter how good my outfit looked, I'd look like a schlub because of my hair.

In my third year of college I studied abroad in Bordeaux, France for a semester. It had been probably twelve years since I started wishing for boy-short hair. 

Unlike most study abroad experiences you hear about, mine wasn't a dream-come-true. Culture shock, loneliness, and various unfortunate events in my life caused my mental health to go down the drain, and my schoolwork was suffering because of it. My long-distance boyfriend at the time was pulling away and I needed a change. I asked my roommate for moral support and we went to the salon on November 2nd, 2010.

Within three cuts I knew I had made the right decision. Instead of making my face look chubby like I had expected, my pixie framed it in a really flattering way. This was a huge improvement over wearing it back in a ponytail.

Cutting my hair off gave me an extra hour+ every day to do whatever I wanted. I felt like I could finally wear cute outfits without worrying that my hair was ruining the look. Actually, since I didn't have to take so much time to do my hair, it finally felt acceptable to spend a few minutes thinking about my outfit.

People who know me in person know that my thing now is that I *need* to wear earrings every day. I feel naked without them. I have a huge collection of cute earrings, which makes me a shit minimalist. But earrings last forever and they're 100% reusable, plus they take up so little space that it's barely noticable.

I guarantee the best way to receive regular compliments is to get a cute pixie cut and start wearing cute earrings. One time I got four compliments on my earrings in a one-hour period. And I've never spent much more than $10 on a pair.

Maybe it's superficial. Maybe it's vain. I don't really care. I'm always going to judge my own appearance more harshly than I'll judge anyone else's appearance. If looking good makes it easier for me to get through life, it's not wasted effort. It's self-care.
