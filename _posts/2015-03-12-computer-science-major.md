title: Computer Science Major

Computer science is a huge, never-ending field.

A long time ago I saved [this ginormous article](http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/) listing all of the topics a CS major should have working knowledge of. Previously, I found it intimidating, but now after working at a software company for a few months and understanding how any software product depends on nearly every topic mentioned in the article, I'm gaining motivation to learn all these things.

This is part of the reason why I'm not in a rush to graduate. I guess each quarter I put off graduating is another three months without a full-time developer salary, but I don't want to just be a Joe Schmoe developer. I want to be the person others ask to solve their problems.

Part of me thinks of the trope of knowing just enough to be dangerous, especially when it comes to software products where there's no federal administration standard for quality. But I shouldn't hesitate to learn things. I'm already learning a ton.

I think this blog is motivating me to absorb information, too. I mean, what's the point of learning stuff if you can't tell the world about it? I just love explaining things, probably. Blame my previous experience as a teacher.

I'll list the topics here for my own reference.

<h3 class="anchor" id="my-thinking">My Thinking</h3>

Topics I feel like I should be good at already or fairly soon:

- Technical communication
- Data structures and algorithms
- User experience design

Topics I wish I frickin' knew already:

- The Unix philosophy
- Systems administration
- An engineering core
- Discrete math (I took the class but I don't remember much)
- Formal methods

Topics I can learn about from my current internship:

- Software testing
- Security
- Networking
- Cryptography
- Software engineering
- Databases
- JavaScript
- Java

Topics I should learn in my classes this year (2015):

- Data structures and algorithms (winter and spring)
- ANSI C
- Architecture (winter)
- Assembly language (winter)
- Operating systems
- Databases (spring or summer)
- User experience design (summer or fall or later)
- Software engineering (summer or fall)
- Networking (fall or later)

Topics I'm not going to worry about until I have everything else down:

- Artificial intelligence
- Robotics
- Graphics and simulation

I feel like if I have working knowledge of everything on the list besides these last three, I can call myself a real software engineer.










<h3 class="anchor" id="coursework">Coursework</h3>

But I have to be careful that I don't try to do everything at once. I shouldn't bite off more than I can chew.
It's nice to have exposure to different topics but that's not how I'm going to become knowledgeable. Or maybe it is? I go back and forth on this a lot.

I mean, we learn best through immersion. If I dive in and just try to absorb everything, I'll learn a lot in the process.

That's why I'm so lucky at my current internship. I should talk to my QA lead and the QA manager about my goals while I'm working there. Seeing the applications of all these hazy topics to solve actual problems in real softare makes it stick a lot better. 

But what if I sink? I don't want to overwhelm myself.

That brings me back to the topic hanging over my head right now: which classes should I take next quarter?

| Course | Level of Difficulty | Quarter |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Algorithms | hard | spring |
| Databases | not too hard | spring or summer |
| Operating Systems | hard | spring or fall |
| Web Development | probably easy | summer or eventually |
| Software Engineering I | medium | summer or fall |

<br/>

I definitely want to take Algorithms in the spring, because then I'll have plenty of time to solidify my data structures and algorithms knowledge for interviews (thanks to [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://smile.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1426189218&sr=8-1&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview), which probably deserves a whole section in the article I linked at the beginning).

Database knowledge will also help me get a good developer internship/job since you see MySQL listed in every job posting ever. I actually became interested in computer science after taking a GIS class that exposed me to databases for the first time. I don't think it's going to be super easy, but every discussion of databases I've encountered so far has been really interesting to me.

Before I started my internship I wanted to take Web Development because I wanted to learn the tools I'd need to build a Github portfolio, but now I'm actually learning more about web development at work than I would have been in the class. I'm hoping by the time I take it, I'll have this stuff down so solid that it'll be fairly easy.

I have ten classes left to take after this quarter:

- CS 290 Web Development
- CS 275 Introduction to Databases (prereq: CS 290)
- CS 352 Introduction to Usability Engineering
- CS 325 Analysis of Algorithms
- CS 361 Software Engineering I
- CS 362 Software Engineering II
- CS 372 Intro to Computer Networks
- CS 344 Operating Systems
- CS 496 Mobile and Cloud Software Development (prereq: CS 344)
- CS 419 Software Projects (prereqs: CS 275 & CS 496)

If I take three classes a quarter (two classes during summer) I can do something like this:

| *Winter 2015* 	| Spring 2015       | Summer 2015            | Fall 2015 			   |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *Data Structures*	| Algorithms        | Software Engineering I | Software Engineering II |
| *Assembly Language* | Web Development | Databases | Mobile and Cloud |
| 					| Operating Systems |         				 | Computer Networks       |
| | | |
| **Winter 2016** | **Spring 2016** |
| Usability Engineering   | Software Projects	 	 |
| (Software Projects?)  | 	 |

<br/>

If I take two classes a quarter (two classes during summer) I can do something like this:

| *Winter 2015* | Spring 2015       | Summer 2015            | Fall 2015 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *Data Structures* | Algorithms        | Software Engineering I | Software Engineering II |
| *Assembly Language* | Web Development         | Databases  | Operating Systems |
| | | |
| **Winter 2016** | **Spring 2016** |
| Mobile and Cloud  | Software Projects	 	 |
| Computer Networks | Usability Engineering	 	 |

<br/>

If I skip summer I can do something like this:

| *Winter 2015* | Spring 2015       | Summer 2015 | Fall 2015              | 
| :---| :---| :--- | :--- |
| *Data Structures* | Algorithms        | *Internship* | Software Engineering I | 
| *Assembly Language* | Web Development         | *Projects* | Operating Systems  	 | 
| | | |
| **Winter 2016**      	   | **Spring 2016**        | **Summer 2016** | **Fall 2016** |
| Software Engineering II  | Mobile and Cloud		| *Internship* | Software Projects |
| Computer Networks 	   | Databases	| *Job hunting* | Usability Engineering   |

<br/>

I'm leaning toward that last one because I'll have a good opportunity for a [proper Silicon Valley summer internship](http://news.yahoo.com/silicon-valleys-interns-enjoy-perk-filled-summer-151000107--finance.html) (sorry for the Yahoo article, eugh).
