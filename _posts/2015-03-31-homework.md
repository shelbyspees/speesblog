I have a problem.

I've found that I really like doing homework. But only if I can post it here. I will write paragraph after paragraph breaking down pseudocode or explaining my analysis if it's posted for the world to see. But if I'm just going to turn it in and let it be forgotten, I don't want to do it.

When I'm learning something I've found it only matters to me once I can publish it. I have to make it pretty, formatted, clean. I obsess over proofreading and perfecting my presentation of this knowledge, and in the process it sinks in.

Can't I just publish my homework? I don't want it to live in generic .docx and .c files in my Dropbox. I want my code to relish in its lavender backdrop. I want my descriptions to sit neatly in the content `<div>` I customized, bordered by drop shadow to improve readability.

Markdown is wonderful. HTML is even better. Microsoft Word is too mainstream, too limiting. Let me prettify my assignment. Let me make it accessible.

I mean, it's not like anyone reads this anyway.
