I usually don't like to make fun of people. Ok, yeah I do, but not publicly. But I learned a lesson about dating this past week and I think it's an important story to share.

{content here}

After I got home from the date I deleted our initial message conversation. I already decided I didn't want to go out with this guy again. I thought about what I'd say if he asked about a second date and decided that the vast difference in life experience is already a huge dealbreaker for me. 

Plus he seemed so nervous! I've been in a relationship where I had to coddle the guy, hold his hand all the time, always make sure he was ok. He'd freak out over every little thing. It was draining and a waste of my time. I was bending over backwards for him but getting nothing in return for my emotional labor. 

I wish relationships didn't end up being so transactional but they are. I've been taken advantage of enough times in my short 25 years. It's time to focus on my needs.
