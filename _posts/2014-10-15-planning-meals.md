I used to have a problem with binge eating disorder. I suppose I still do. I'm in remission? Or something.

Lately I haven't had much of an appetite. This is not unhealthy in itself. It's nice that I don't associate a mild hunger pang with crushing despair at this point.

What's not healthy is my nutrition. Skipping meals isn't a problem in itself when the meals I do eat have enough nutrients. This isn't the case for me right now.

I've always been lazy about cooking. I think it's an environmental/family thing. My mom hates cooking. I don't think I've ever had a healthy diet for any significant length of time.

The planning part is fun for me. The actual grocery shopping and preparing and cooking and cleaning up is less fun.

But even though I love intellectualizing my diet, at this point I can't even bring myself to think about food.

Oh man, I'm shaking. I should probably eat something soon.

The weird thing about my hunger lately compared to before is that when I'm hungry now, it's accompanied by nausea. So food isn't really appetizing like it was before.
