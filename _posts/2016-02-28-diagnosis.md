I haven't been writing much at all lately. I think I want to take this opportunity to clearly spell out what's going on inside my head right now. **Content warning: mental illness.**

## My History

The first time I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder was in December of 2010. I started taking medication and stopped 18 months later without consulting my doctor when I graduated with my BA in June of 2012. I was re-diagnosed with depression in August of 2014 and restarted the medication a month later. (I think I'll write a timeline of my depression symptoms sometime in the future.)

This past October 2015 I started seeing a new therapist who pointed out that some of the issues I was describing with my depression are common in people with ADHD. While my psychiatrist at the time dismissed the possibility of an ADHD diagnosis---"If you weren't diagnosed as a child then you don't have it," he assured me---my therapist brought it up again last month.

I got her attention when I described the trouble I have waking up in the morning. Apparently it's not normal to be dizzy to the point of blacking out when you first get up, or to have your heart race first thing in the morning. I always figured it was low blood pressure.

Dreading school and homework was also a sign, apparently. I'm continuously learning how much more homework freaks me out than it does other people.

She had me take the ADHD screening (which I finished ridiculously fast---I've always been a good test taker). Despite my results showing many signs of ADHD, my new psychiatrist wasn't eager to jump on board a for-sure diagnosis, especially with my depression still causing problems. She increased my antidepressant dose, which I wasn't sure would help my ability to focus. Still, I felt better knowing there could be more answers out there to explain my struggling.

## My Symptoms

### Major Depressive Disorder:

- sadness, emotional pain
- numbness, overall low mood
- chronic fatigue, low energy
- chronic oversleeping
- negative self-assessment, worthlessness
- social isolation
- slowness in movements and speech
- difficulty concentrating
- difficulty making decisions, uninterested in future
- actively self-destructive behavior like bingeing (binge eating disorder), wasting money, malnourishment
- suicidal ideation

### Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder:

#### *Inattention*

- losing train of thought mid-sentence
- frequently jumping among conversation topics
- poor sense of time (especially determining how long it takes to do things or go places)
- problems starting new tasks or switching between tasks
- complete failure to ever finish tasks/projects
- poor relationship with future self (also depression)
- hours-long periods of hyperfocus (reading books, organizing clothes, tinkering with code, writing blog posts)
- difficulty listening, won't hear conversation if there's background noise
- frequently overwhelmed by mental stimulation/distractions, i.e. at parties

#### *Impulsivity*

- interrupting to give answers, finish sentences, contradict at inappropriate times
- compulsive eating (binge eating disorder)
- impulse purchases including clothes, food, makeup, books

### Binge Eating Disorder:

- eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than what most people would eat in a similar period of time under similar circumstances
- eating is out of control
- eating when already full, not hungry
- eating quickly (pint of ice cream in 5-10 mins)
- eating until uncomfortably full, stomach ache (as punishment)
- eating alone or in secret (always, since high school)
- bingeing at least once a week for 3+ months
- no compensatory behavior like restricting, purging
- bingeing is a means of relieving tension or numbing negative feelings

## More about ADHD

[ADHD manifests differently in girls](http://www.addvance.com/help/women/daydreamer.html) than in boys, so it often goes undiagnosed, especially in girls who are intellectually gifted:

>Many girls with above average IQ can keep it together academically until they hit middle school, or even high school. <mark>As their school life becomes more demanding and complicated in the upper grades, their problems with concentration, organization and follow-through are more likely to reveal themselves.</mark>

The risk-taking tomboy with messy handwriting and bedroom:

>But unlike many boys with ADD (ADHD), these girls are often more cooperative at home, and may work harder to please their teacher at school. <mark>Their handwriting may be messy, they are often disorganized, and they may rush out the door for their next activity leaving their room a huge mess.</mark> Rather than suspecting ADD (ADHD), parents and teachers of these girls may see them as undisciplined and just not academically inclined.

This is 100% me all throughout elementary school.

>Many quiet girls with ADD (ADHD) seem to be listening to their teachers, while their minds are a thousand miles away. . .They are forgetful and disorganized in completing their school work and become very worried as assignments come due. <mark>When sent to their room to complete homework they may quietly daydream at their desk unless they are kept on track by a parent sitting beside them.</mark>

"Stop procrastinating!" is what I heard nearly every day from age 6 until I no longer required babysitting.

Is it procrastinating if you can't focus? Was I just being lazy? Everything in the world was vying for my attention when I sat down at the kitchen table to do homework. TV commercials or MSNBC in the background, the dogs going in and out, the clock ringing every hour from 4:00pm until 7-8:00pm when my mom would give in and sit down with me to go through the problems one by one.

If I tried doing homework alone in my room, I'd stare at the wall and daydream for hours. Same with cleaning, folding clothes, etc.

I thought everyone had these problems. I thought everyone hated homework the way I do, to the point where it still makes me want to cry after 20 years of educational success. I thought everyone had to actively fight their meandering imaginations.

I've learned coping strategies over the years, but in high school the hyperactivity and inattention melded into a kind of chattiness that's apparently common among girls with ADHD. If this doesn't sound like me since age 15, you don't know me very well:

>They interrupt others frequently and jump from topic to topic in conversation. These girls may have trouble explaining a story line or movie plot - frequently interrupting themselves to say "wait a minute, I forgot to tell you..." Or they tell the story in a very confused manner because they have trouble organizing their thoughts before they start talking. . .<mark>These girls may adopt a "silly" personality to mask their disorganization and forgetfulness.</mark>

Once I started talking I didn't shut up, but I couldn't sound consistently smart like my peers so I played dumb/silly. People find it charming, or at least disarming, but it would be nice to be able to tell a story linearly without having to write it out first.

[Here's another article](http://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/childhood-adhd/features/adhd-different-girls) that describes me exactly:

><mark>Rather than troublemakers, girls with ADHD tend to be daydreamers.</mark> “Your daughter may do what she’s told, but she might have difficulty focusing, paying attention, or finishing her work,” Manos says.
>
>Still, bad grades aren’t always a telltale sign. “Girls sometimes continue to do well in school, particularly if they’re very bright or hard working,” Quinn says. “They compensate. <mark>Parents might not realize there’s a problem, but the girls recognize that they need a lot more help than anyone else, and they realize that they’re different.”</mark>
>
>If schoolwork or other tasks just seem harder for your daughter than they do for other kids -- <mark>if she’s staying up late doing homework, if she’s only able to study when conditions are “just so,”</mark> if she’s dreading going to school -- those are signals that there may be something going on, Quinn says.

In elementary school and middle school, I could *maybe* get work done by myself with the TV off, but only if I wasn't already several hours into a frustrating 'procrastination' session.

[Here's another great article](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/04/adhd-is-different-for-women/381158/) about how ADHD manifests differently in women.

My brain chemistry is already different due to my depression, and I'm quite positive I was wired differently from the beginning.

Of course if you're not climbing up the walls, if you do fairly well in school and in life, it's ridiculous to think you have ADHD:

>As a fairly driven adult female who found the strength to sit through biology lectures and avoid major academic or social failures, I, too, was initially perplexed by my diagnosis. My peers were also confused, and rather certain my psychiatrist was misguided. <mark>“Of course you don’t have ADHD. You’re smart,”</mark> a friend told me.

When you hear about ADHD you imagine restless, overactive white boys running in circles. [The medical community in general](http://www.bu.edu/today/2014/why-medical-research-often-ignores-women/) suffers from an overabundance of male research subjects and fails to distinguish results based on gender differences.

>She attributes the under-diagnosis of girls and women—it is estimated that there are around 4 million who are not diagnosed, or half to three-quarters of all women with ADHD—and the misunderstandings that have ensued about the disorder as it manifests in females, to the early clinical studies of ADHD in the 1970s. “These studies were based on really hyperactive young white boys who were taken to clinics,” Littman says. “The diagnostic criteria were developed based on those studies. As a result, <mark>those criteria over-represent the symptoms you see in young boys, making it difficult for girls to be diagnosed unless they behave like hyperactive boys.”</mark>

While men and women are about [99% alike biologically](http://genetics.thetech.org/ask/ask38), we're incredibly socialized to conform to gender stereotypes. This socialization, plus physiological differences, affects how illnesses and other conditions manifest in different genders.

>“Often, if girls are smart or in supportive homes, symptoms are masked,” Solden says. “Because they’re not hyperactive or causing trouble for other people, <mark>they’re usually not diagnosed until they hit a wall, often at college,</mark> marriage, or pregnancy. A lot of things that are simple and routine to other people—like buying groceries, making dinner, keeping track of possessions, and responding to emails—do not become automatic to these women, which can be embarrassing and exhausting.”

Sure, I've been able to cope for the past few years, but as my life gets increasingly complicated I want to be confident that I can consistently hold it together. I've already had to push back enough goals and commitments due to my depression. I want the chance to be reliable, consistent.

With the increased dose of antidepressants I'm now functioning at about 30% capacity. A month ago I was running at 5%. My goal is 80%, including:

- quality sleep ~7-8h/night (not 10+ hours like in December/January)
- near-daily exercise
- consistently healthy meals
- consistent progress on work projects
- consistent effort on school assignments
- regular social interaction
- daily self-care

That way I have a 20% cushion if I need to kick it into high gear for a bit. Most neurotypical people can run at 75-100%+ without thinking about it. I never have been and I never will be one of those people.
