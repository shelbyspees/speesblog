I just got this question in a direct message on reddit and I thought I'd post my answer here, mostly for my own benefit.

>Hi there,
>I came across one of your posts in a thread about attending career fairs and saw you are in OSU's post-bac program. I'm about to enter the program and I'm curious about your experiences with it.
>Regarding the career fair that you went to, how receptive did the recruiters seem to the facts that 1) Your CS degree wasn't through the school they were currently at, 2) The OSU program is 100% online?
>I'd definitely like to take advantage of my alma mater's career fair as it's a top CS school (University of Michigan) and thus very well attended by employers in the industry. I'm worried though, that the recruiters will think lesser of me by comparing me to the in-person Michigan CS students, who unfortunately on paper will probably be more attractive as intern candidates.
>I would also appreciate your general opinion of the program/any tips you would have for someone like me who is just starting it. Thanks!

If you think of yourself as lesser they'll smell that. I told them up front that my situation is a little different and I'm not a student at that school. My first degree is on my resume with my GPA and stuff. If you seem positive and well-spoken and confident you'll totally stand out among the crowd of awkward STEM majors (obviously not all are awkward but they're definitely the majority). There's also a certain humility implied in going back to school and people seem to like that.
One bit of advice I'll give is show interest in the company at career fairs. I usually research the companies that'll be there and make a list of which ones are looking for developers/dev interns so I know who to prioritize. Also, if it's a company that's less than ten years old, ask how the company got started--especially if the person there has an important title like VP or Engineering Manager or something. I was so sheltered from all this stuff growing up that I thought all companies were evil and sociopathic but it's really interesting to learn about how people will start companies to solve problems in specific domains.

It's mostly luck though. You just need the right person to see your resume and want to interview you. For my current internship I applied through Indeed and the company emailed me to apply for a different position in their system cause the first one was closed but I guess they liked my resume? And I've been getting nonstop positive feedback since I started. I'm giving a presentation next week and my manager told me not to lose my bubbliness. I'm glad I'm a little different I guess.
Be proactive. I'm constantly reading software blogs and books because I'm just really interested in software as an industry. Here's my reading list of books like this: http://shelbyspees.me/speesblog/reading/software/

It helps you gain perspective and it's a nice change when you've filled your quota on technical learning for the day. But maybe I'm just a nerd who likes reading nonfiction. Plus it gives you nice nuggets of wisdom to drop when your subdivision manager wants to sit down and chat. "I like this company because there's a lot of trust in the engineers and from my understanding you don't see that in a lot of companies." For example.
I think also since I come from a social sciences background I may come across as less entitled to a job than the CS students at whatever school it is. I'm like, "I'm an old bag now, I can't keep up with these kids. I just want to work."

About OSU's program. It's really not that different from the classes I took during my undergrad, except the lectures are pre-recorded. At this point I like working wayyyy more than I like school and I want to just graduate already. I think the difference is the people. I feel really isolated in my classes because I don't have anyone I can complain to about it in person. At work everyone gets this software stuff, but at home everyone's like, "That's nice..." So my advice would be to find ways to avoid that kind of isolation.

One of the things I learned this past year being in the program is that programming will destroy your ego on a certain level. You're pretty much being told by a computer all day on repeat: "You're wrong. You're wrong. You're wrong." Until eventually you fix it and move onto the next thing you're wrong about. Eventually you realize it's ok not to know things, and the computer isn't smarter than you. It's a lot dumber actually because it can't get the gist of what you're trying to do. You have to spell it out in exact terms.

The configuration stuff is a pain in the ass no matter what. I know professional software engineers of 10+ years who have to google how to create a new project in their IDE every time they do it. It's that unnecessarily complicated. And it pisses me off because it's a huge barrier to entry for a lot of people who would really enjoy the logic side of programming. So don't get discouraged your first week. And you WILL need to read the directions. And probably google something in one of the steps to find directions on how to do that. I'm a figure-it-out kind of person so it took me a long time to get that.

If you're not comfortable using the command line yet, you'll get used to it fast. Don't worry, you won't break your computer.
The discussion board for each of your classes is super overwhelming. They give me legit anxiety because people are constantly asking and answering questions. It's like Tuesday and you're halfway done with the reading and people are asking questions about like the last part of the assignment due Sunday and you're like "SLOW THE FUCK DOWN PEOPLE."

On that note, don't wait until you're done with the reading and lectures to start on the assignment. I prefer to absorb the material first and then work on the assignments, but that's always bit me in the ass. I haven't figured out how to time it the best way quite yet but hopefully you'll figure out what works for you.

Ok I'll shut up now. Hope this helps.
