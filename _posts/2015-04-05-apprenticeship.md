I'm pretty much done reading [*Apprenticeship Patterns*](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/index.html), although it's definitely a book I'm going to revisit often. You can read an alphabetized list of the patterns [here](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/apa.html).

While reading this book I was simultaneously inspired and overwhelmed by the amount of learning I want to do. In order to maintain my sanity I'm going to list a few of the patterns I want to focus on and remember now until I build more of my technical skills, at which point I can reread the book for renewed inspiration.

<h2 class="anchor" id="the-long-road">The Long Road</h2>

I believe this is the most important pattern I can take away, especially at this early point in my career.

I have a shit-ton of hard work ahead of me. I'm going to have to learn and relearn so many things over the next year, let alone the next five years or ten years or twenty years.

It's going to be crucial that I keep this pattern in mind. **My career isn't a sprint, it's a marathon.**






<h2 class="anchor" id="beginner-skills">Beginner Skills</h2>

I want to combine several patterns here:

- Your First Language
- Concrete Skills
- Be the Worst
- Sweep the Floor
- Practice, Practice, Practice
- Breakable Toys

My programming skills are nowhere near solid at this point. I need serious practice if I'm going to be passing technical interviews any time soon.

I guess C++ is my first language. I've used Ruby in a professional environment but C++ is more commonly used for DS&A interviews.

At this point I'm not even sure if I could Sweep the Floor as a developer. I don't know what the broom looks like. I guess it wouldn't hurt to ask in that situation. The point of this pattern is to learn the nitty-gritty stuff I wouldn't learn in a classroom.

Practice is crucial though. I have [*Cracking the Coding Interview*](), [*Introduction to Algorithms*](), [*The Algorithm Design Manual*](). I have the internet: HackerRank, CodingBat, TopCoder. Am I avoiding this kind of practice or am I just focused on other stuff right now?

Should I hold off learning Java at this point?





<h2 class="anchor" id="reflection">Reflection</h2>

A few patterns on this topic:

- Expose Your Ignorance
- Confront Your Ignorance
- Reflect As You Work
- Record What You Learn
- Share What You Learn
- Learn How You Fail

I'm attempting to do this with my coursework in a way that won't get me kicked out of school. Unfortunately I'm a starter and not quite a finisher so I end up with a lot of half-written explanations. I'm hoping to get those beautifully completed sooner than later.

These patterns are less relevant right this second but I might as well categorize them like I did the others.
