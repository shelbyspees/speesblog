Yesterday when I was going through my notes from [*Apprenticeship Patterns*](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/index.html) I saw an idea that never hit me before.

>"Keep a record of your journey in a journal, personal wiki, or blog. A chronological record of the lessons you have learned can provide inspiration to those you mentor, since it makes your journey explicit, but it can also give you a vital resource to draw upon."

When I was at my last internship I actually wanted to write a wiki for the team I was on, connecting all the information and specs we were trying to keep track of. I felt like there was a lot of knowledge scattered around the company but no central place where it was organized for people to find, read, and update.

The idea never got past the Idea Board during my time there, but it's been floating around in my head this whole time. After reading that quote I realized that there are better ways to store and organize my notes than this blog.

While I would probably be able to implement a wiki right here within my blog, GitHub is a really useful resource for the kind of notes I keep, and the web design factor is completely removed. The only thing to worry about is content.

This last part is actually why I loved Evernote so much, but Evernote lacks the code formatting functionality I really enjoy. Markdown lacks highlighting though, so it's a toss-up. I'll probably be stuck with resources scattered across multiple tools until I can get reliable in-browser highlighting.

Here you can see how I'm organizing my reading notes for my Web Development class this quarter.

I originally had a single page for each week, but I realized there's so much to cover that it was better to separate out the pages by reading source. Plus this way it'll be easier to link to different topics.

How did I put these notes together in the first place? Well, I *have* to highlight. As I mentioned above, I struggle with online resources because I can't annotate web pages. Right now I have two ways of dealing with this (I hesitate to call them solutions):

**1\. [Evernote Web Clipper](https://evernote.com/webclipper/)**

Now, I love Evernote. I'd shave my head to work at Evernote. It's still the #1 tool I use for keeping track of information.

The Web Clipper is great for two main functions: making site content readable, and copying that content into a new Evernote note.

I do this a lot with longer articles that I want to mark up and save, especially ones that are impossible to read on the source website like this one:

Opening Web Clipper makes it gorgeously readable like you see below, and combined with Chrome's Presentation Mode it's easy to get through articles without becoming distracted.

I've actually [reposted](http://shelbyspees.github.io/speesblog/leadership/2015/03/01/the-guru-myth.html) this exact article and several others from the book onto my blog for this exact reason. I like being able to read text, don't you?

Usually before even reading the article I know whether or not I'll want to save it into Evernote to mark up some time later (because otherwise I'll save it into [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/add/?ep=1) or not at all). If so then I'll click the **Save to Evernote** button.

Here's what the note looks like after I mark it up:
