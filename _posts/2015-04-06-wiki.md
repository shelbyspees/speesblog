Yesterday when I was going through my notes from [<i class="fa fa-book"></i> *Apprenticeship Patterns*](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/index.html) I saw an idea that never hit me before.

>"Keep a record of your journey in a journal, personal wiki, or blog. A chronological record of the lessons you have learned can provide inspiration to those you mentor, since it makes your journey explicit, but it can also give you a vital resource to draw upon."
>
>-- Chapter 5: Perpetual Learning, "Record What You Learn"

I've been more or less recording my *journey as a software apprentice* on this blog and in Evernote but the idea of a personal wiki was brand new.

<aside name="journey" style="top: 350px;"><p>Yeah, "journey," it's cheesy as hell. I'm just going to use the vocabulary my reading provides me with. What's the point in fighting it?</p></aside>

Shared wikis are definitely a thing. When I was at my last internship I actually wanted to write a wiki for the team I was on to connect all the information and specs we were trying to keep track of. I felt like there was a lot of knowledge scattered around the company but no central place where it was organized for people to find, read, and update.

The idea never got past the Idea Board during my time there, but it's been floating around in my head this whole time. After reading the quote from *Apprenticeship Patterns* I realized that there are better ways to store and organize my notes than on this blog.

While I would probably be able to implement a wiki right here within my blog, GitHub is a really useful resource for the kind of notes I keep. Plus the web design factor is completely removed so the only thing to worry about is content.

This last part about focusing on content is actually why I loved Evernote so much, but Evernote lacks the code formatting functionality I really enjoy. Markdown lacks highlighting though, so it's a toss-up. I'll probably be stuck with resources scattered across multiple tools until I can get reliable in-browser highlighting.

Here you can see how I'm organizing my reading notes for my Web Development class this quarter in a GitHub project repo wiki:

<a href="https://github.com/shelbyspees/cs290_notes/wiki/Simple-Git-Examples"><img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/files/notes-wiki.png"/></a>

I originally had a single page for each week, but I realized there's so much to cover that it was better to separate out the pages by reading source. Plus this way it'll be easier to link to different topics.

## Note-Taking Tools

How did I put these notes together in the first place? Well, I *have* to highlight. As I mentioned above, I struggle with online resources because I can't annotate web pages. Right now I have two ways of dealing with this (I hesitate to call them solutions):

### 1. [Evernote Web Clipper](https://evernote.com/webclipper/)

Now, I love Evernote. I'd shave my head to work at Evernote. It's still the #1 tool I use for keeping track of information.

The Web Clipper is great for two main functions: making site content readable, and copying that content into a new Evernote note.

I do this a lot with longer articles that I want to mark up and save, especially ones that are impossible to read on the source website like this one:

<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/files/guru-unreadable.png"/>

Opening Web Clipper makes it gorgeously readable like you see below, and combined with Chrome's Presentation Mode it's easy to get through articles without becoming distracted.

<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/files/guru-readable.png"/>

{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-03-01-the-guru-myth %}

I've actually [reposted]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-03-01-the-guru-myth %}) this exact article and several others from the book onto my blog for this exact reason. I like being able to read text, don't you?

Usually before even reading the article I know whether or not I'll want to save it into Evernote to mark up some time later (because otherwise I'll save it into [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/add/?ep=1) or not at all). If so then I'll click the **Save to Evernote** button.

Here's what the note looks like after I mark it up:

<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/files/guru-note.png"/>

Highlighting is great, isn't it? Don't you wish you could just highlight everywhere? I do. 

Actually I just Googled it again. Before, I found [Diigo](https://www.diigo.com/) but I didn't think it would work for me, and I just found [Marker.to](http://marker.to/). It's closer to what I want, but I'd like a way to go back to the highlighted page without needing a separate URL.

It's probably not impossible to implement this, but I'm not sure the browser wants to bear the burden of storing the locations of hundreds of highlights. It's like bookmarks but a level deeper.

Anyway, back to my resource-hoarding process.

Evernote is also great for manipulating content within a note. I often summarize the most important nuggets of longer articles right at the top of the note. This is particularly useful for listicles:

<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/files/list-note.png"/>

I do usually remove pictures and footnotes, but I like to keep the main content of the article even with twelve introductory paragraphs.

### 2. .pdf downloads

What Evernote doesn't excel at is maintaining the original formatting. This is particularly annoying when I try to clip pages with programming-related content. While the Web Clipper usually maintains monospaced font, in these cases I often prefer the readability on the original site.

Luckily for me, there are a few online books available in .pdf versions. [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is one of them, and I used the annotations I made in my .pdf copy to write the wiki I linked at the beginning of this post.

I like to put boxes around important blocks of information:

<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/files/progit1.png"/>

This is a good example of adding a bit of text to clarify the purpose of a more technical section:

<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/files/progit2.png"/>

Here I added an aside to reiterate the point being made in the text:

<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/files/progit3.png"/>

None of these annotation techniques are remotely special, but they're much easier to use on paper. I just wanted to show examples of how I organize my thoughts when I'm not using paper.

Finding ways to keep track of digital information is a problem being attacked by quite a few software companies right now. I'm interested to see what new tools show up in the next few years.
