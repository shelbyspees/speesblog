Coding alone in the dark

one is the loneliest number


>The worst software out there isn’t the result of one inept author, but the result of code having too many authors, often over years. It doesn’t help that most companies assign maintenance work to either to junior programmers, or demoted (and disengaged) senior ones, neither category having the power to do it right.

My point is that at least in software, it's crucial to give your employees autonomy. Paraphrasing from [Notes to a Software Team Leader: Growing Self Organizing Teams](http://www.amazon.com/Notes-Software-Team-Leader-Organizing/dp/B00FBPIUZG/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) by Roy Osherove and Gorde Edlund (I've been listening to the audiobook on my commute), your product isn't the software you ship. Shipping is merely a side effect of quality project management. Your product is the collective knowledge of the technologists on your project's team. *The quality of the team determines the quality of the product.*

Becoming a technical leader: your job as a leader is to make your team grow

##It's called *maturity*

I've read [<i class="fa fa-book"></i> *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People*]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-03-02-book-review-seven-habits %}) as well as [<i class="fa fa-book"></i> *Working with Emotional Intelligence*]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-03-22-emotional-intelligence %}). These books are long-winded attempts to get whiny adults to grow up. I know, I was one of them (mostly still am actually).

I won't even discuss [<i class="fa fa-book"></i> *How to Win Friends and Influence People*](http://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People-ebook/dp/B003WEAI4E/ref=sr_1_1_ha?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1440473545&sr=1-1&keywords=how+to+win+friends+and+influence+people). To summarize the message: Try to give a shit about people besides yourself. I promise, your life will get easier.
