I've been (slowly) reading Peter Seibel's [<i class="fa fa-book"></i> *Coders at Work*](http://www.codersatwork.com/).

Chapter 3 is the interview with Douglas Crockford, author of [<i class="fa fa-book"></i> *JavaScript: The Good Parts*](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-ebook/dp/B0026OR2ZY/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;sr=&amp;qid=) and famous for specifying and popularizing [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON). I'd like to include some quotes from the book that stood out to me.

##On Roles

>**Seibel:** Do you consider yourself a scientist, an engineer, an artist, a craftsman, or something else?
>
>**Crockford:** <mark>I think of myself as a writer</mark>. Sometimes I write in English and sometimes I write in JavaScript.
>
>It all comes down to communication and the structures that you  use in order to facilitate that communication. Human language and computer languages work very differently in many ways, but <mark>ultimately I judge a computer program by its ability to communicate with a human who reads that program</mark>. So at that level, they're not that different.

Joel Spolsky made a similar point when [giving advice to college students](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CollegeAdvice.html) and Jeff Atwood [has admitted](http://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-write-without-writing/) that his motivation for starting Stack Overflow was to trick people into becoming better communicators. Jeff has even repeated the following quote from Joel in multiple blog posts on Coding Horror:

><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> The difference between a tolerable programmer and a great programmer is not how many programming languages they know, and it's not whether they prefer Python or Java. It's whether they can communicate their ideas.  
>  
> --- <cite>Joel Spolsky, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CollegeAdvice.html">"Advice for Computer Science College Students"</a></cite>

It's clear that a few influential professionals think that programming is very close to writing. When people ask me about my studies, I tell them that computers are very stupid and they don't understand nuance. My job as a programmer is to break down into very specific steps what I want the computer to do, in terms that the computer will understand. Programmers are computer whisperers. We boss computers around.

While that's all well and good, computers don't buy your product. People do. If you want your project to be a positive force for the people involved, you have to make it so that it's understandable by people. I'm including every layer of human that your software touches until it reaches the end user: you, your team, QA, management, sales, support, the user, you again when you go back to do maintenance.

##On Literacy

>**Seibel:** So Djikstra had a famous paper, "On the cruelty of really teaching computing science," that basically said computer programming is a branch of applied math. Do you agree?
>
>**Crockford:** Mathematics is important in programming, but it's just one of a lot of things that are important. I think if you overemphasize the math then you underemphasize stuff which might be even more important, such as literacy.
>
>I mentioned I wanted to have the hiring requirement that they had to have read Knuth and I couldn't do that because I couldn't find enough people who had. The other thing I wanted was that they be really literate in whatever language they write to other humans. <mark>I want people who can write, because we spend a lot of time writing to each other</mark>. We're writing email or documentation. We're writing plans. We're writing specifications. I want to know that the people on my team are capable of doing that, and that turns out to be a really difficult skill. So I would actually rather see people start as English majors than as math majors to get into programming. 

Why is literacy important? Reading is learning. Writing is teaching. Any project you work on will involve other humans. Unfortunately we haven't perfected telepathy quite yet, which means you're going to have to open your mouth and talk at some point or at least type out a few words. The more effective you get at this important job requirement the more smoothly your projects will go.

##On Hiring

>**Seibel:** When you're hiring programmers, how do you recognize the good ones?
>
>**Crockford:** The approach I've taken now is to do a code reading. I invite the candidate to bring in a piece of code he's really proud of and walk us through it.
>
>**Seibel:** And what are you looking for?
>
>**Crockford:** I'm looking for quality of presentation. I want to see what he thinks is something he's proud of. I want to see evidence that in fact he is the author of the thing that he's defending. I find that it much more effective than asking them to solve puzzles or trivia questions. I see all that kind of stuff as useless. But <mark>how effectively they can communicate, that's a skill that I'm hiring for</mark>.

This point struck a chord with me since I religiously follow [/r/cscareerquestions](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions) and the subreddit constantly discussed how to prepare for technical interviews. Should we have to practice dozens of [algorithms problems](http://www.careercup.com/page?pid=algorithm-interview-questions) in order to show that we're qualified for a job?

While I think there's absolutely a place for the current trend of having candidates whiteboard-code a solution
to a difficult problem, Crockford gives a nice solution to a gap I've noticed when I hear about the hiring process. 

Non-technical interviewers ask behavioral questions to judge the candidate's personality and work style. Technical interviewers ask coding questions to test the candidate's technical knowledge. Shouldn't the candidate's prospective team have a chance to judge the candidate on both their technical knowledge and their softer traits (personality, communication, presentation skills)?

##My Thoughts

While I'm obviously very biased, I like Crockford's points here because I think communication is just so important. We're humans, we can't read each others' minds. Literally everything that's ever been created has been the result of some sort of communication. Here's my thinking:

- Communication is explaining
- Explaining is teaching
- Teaching is leadership

People who can communicate well can be very effective in effecting change in whatever role they play. And I believe every career path has a place for teaching. We need more great teachers in this world and that starts with encouraging people to build their communication skills.

Trust me, in elementary school and middle school I literally could not get words on paper. I'd sit in silence staring at the page, mind completely blank. Free writing assignments were like pulling teeth for me. I cried my way through four years of honors and AP English classes in high school (my standardized test scores for reading comprehension were what roped me in).

Two things helped change that: 1. I began filling up notebooks with the boy-crazy stream-of-consciousness musings of a sixteen-year-old girl, and 2. my 11th grade English teacher with skyscraping standards made us write timed essays every week. It turns out the more words you write the easier it becomes. By college I was getting compliments on my writing. In only a few years my writing abilities took a 180-degree turnaround.

It's actually this experience building my writing skills that gives me the confidence that I can become a good programmer with practice. I'm glad I can maintain that growth mindset now.
