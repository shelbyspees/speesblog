I just finished listening to Stephen King's On Writing and there are some killer quotes I want to discuss (pun probably intended).

#C.V.

I don't want to dwell on the details of Stephen King's life. I wouldn't do him justice. You have to pay for the book and read it yourself. It's a hell of a story.

What stood out to me the most wasn't the inspiration or the magic that created King's novels. There wasn't a lot of magic happening. It was the pure hard work. He worked his ass off, submitting stories all through high school and college. He collected all his rejection letters and hung them from a stake on his wall. He didn't cry and give up when publishers failed to hand him a life of success on a silver platter.

The story of Stephen King isn't one of creative inspiration. It's one of blood, sweat, and determination. I'm sure he had a lot of latent talent (wow that's fun to type). I'm sure he was a top-notch wordsmith from the beginning. But his success came from the work, not the talent.

#What Writing Is

I wish I had the space and time to discuss every quote I found highlightable. Stephen King packs a lot of meaty advice into this book.

##Toolbox

>Put your vocabulary on the top shelf of your toolbox, and don’t make any conscious effort to improve it. (You’ll be doing that as you read, of course . . . but that comes later.) One of the really bad things you can do to your writing is to dress up the vocabulary, looking for long words because you’re maybe a little bit ashamed of your short ones. This is like dressing up a household pet in evening clothes. The pet is embarrassed and the person who committed this act of premeditated cuteness should be even more embarrassed.

One of King's main pieces of advice to aspiring writers is to use the tools at their disposal. It's common to hear that you should "write what you know," which King discusses later in his book when he gets to story topics. It's the same here for vocabulary. You're not going to write a convincing story

King argues that stories aren't something writers make up. The story already exists in its entirety deep in the writer's mind. The writer's job is to uncover this story--excavate it with the tools in his toolbox. In order to stay true to the story, you can't force it on the page with flowery language or cliche plot devices. The process is more like transcription, and here King advises writers to stay true to the story as the words arrive in their minds:

>The word is only a representation of the meaning; even at its best, writing almost always falls short of full meaning. Given that, why in God’s name would you want to make things worse by choosing a word which is only cousin to the one you really wanted to use?

When King discusses style, he avoids giving any direct advice, instead referencing Strunk and White's The Elements of Style. The classic style guide provides this gem:

>“Unless he is certain of doing well, [the writer] will probably do best to follow the rules.”

>Language does not always have to wear a tie and lace-up shoes. The object of fiction isn’t grammatical correctness but to make the reader welcome and then tell a story . . . to **make him/her forget, whenever possible, that he/she is reading a story at all.**

##Magic

>At its most basic we are only discussing a learned skill, but do we not agree that sometimes the most basic skills can create things far beyond our expectations? We are talking about tools and carpentry, about words and style . . . but as we move along, you’d do well to remember that we are also talking about magic.

Magic. That's a strong word. I see where King is coming from though. The feeling of *flow*, when your skill meets the challenge so precisely that you lose track of time. I've been there before.

The magic King mentions is also a type of synergy. It's not a perfect example, since synergy is usually when a group of people comes together and creates a whole greater than the sum of its parts. But isn't that what a story is? Something greater than the collection of words that form it?

That's why you shouldn't worry about fancy vocabulary or perfect plot. What creates the story isn't these pieces, it's the magic gluing them together.

#On Writing

>If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot. There’s no way around these two things that I’m aware of, no shortcut.

It's as simple as that. The "write a lot" part is probably obvious, though some people will sit down to write their first novel with zero practice writing short stories. They stare at the blank page thinking, "I can't write like Faulkner. I'm no Hemingway," and give up.

No, the way to approach learning to write is to avoid perfection.

In order to get good at writing, you need to dump out all your crap writing first. Can you think of any child prodigy writers? Writing isn't that kind of talent. The only way you can excel at wielding the written word is by throwing down all the words you can stand. After going through about a million of them you'll start producing something decent.

The writing part is pretty clear to most people though. What shocks me is when I meet someone who claims to be a writer who then utters the words, "Yeah I don't really like reading."

How can you not like reading?? You're a writer. Words are your currency.

There's no excuse.

>If you don’t have time to read, you don’t have the time (or the tools) to write. Simple as that.

It's like a shopaholic who doesn't like earning money, only spending it. Sooner or later you're going to run out of money.

>Reading is the creative center of a writer’s life.

You said it, Stephen King.

>The real importance of reading is that it creates an ease and intimacy with the process of writing. . .The more you read, the less apt you are to make a fool of yourself with your pen or word processor.

Reading teaches you the clichés to avoid. It shows you the many ways to describe visual scenes. You see examples of natural dialogue and very unnatural dialogue. You can't help but learn by example.

Plus, as a side effect it expands your vocabulary.

It's one of the cheapest (free if you use the library) and most enriching hobbies you can have. I'd argue that reading is always an excellent use of your time.

Please read. More. Yes. Thank you.

##Subject Matter

>What are you going to write about? And the equally big answer: Anything you damn well want. Anything at all . . . as long as you tell the truth.

The truth? But this is fiction we're talking about.

Stop right there. The story is fictional, but if you want people to pay attention to it then you're going to want to plant a nugget of truth there. Or, to go back to my earlier point: You're not making up the story. The story already exists. You're merely revealing it. Excavating.

Stay true to that story. That's what people want to read.

>Book-buyers aren’t attracted, by and large, by the literary merits of a novel; book-buyers want a good story to take with them on the airplane, something that will first fascinate them, then pull them in and keep them turning the pages. This happens, I think, when readers recognize the people in a book, their behaviors, their surroundings, and their talk.

>Write what you like, then imbue it with life and make it unique by blending in your own personal knowledge of life, friendship, relationships, sex, and work.

>I distrust plot for two reasons: first, because our lives are largely plotless, even when you add in all our reasonable precautions and careful planning; and second, because I believe plotting and the spontaneity of real creation aren’t compatible.

King discusses the evils of over description

>The key to good description begins with clear seeing and ends with clear writing, the kind of writing that employs fresh images and simple vocabulary.

>Practice the art, always reminding yourself that your job is to say what you see, and then to get on with your story.

##Characters

>I think the best stories always end up being about the people rather than the event, which is to say character-driven.

>It’s also important to remember that no one is “the bad guy” or “the best friend” or “the whore with a heart of gold” in real life; **in real life we each of us regard ourselves as the main character, the protagonist, the big cheese; the camera is on us, baby.**

##The Process

>The great thing about writing with the door shut is that you find yourself forced to concentrate on story to the exclusion of practically everything else.

>Here’s something else—if no one says to you, “Oh Sam (or Amy)! This is wonderful!,” you are a lot less apt to slack off or to start concentrating on the wrong thing . . . *being wonderful,* for instance, instead of *telling the goddam story.*

>What I want most of all is resonance, something that will linger for a little while in Constant Reader’s mind (and heart) after he or she has closed the book and put it up on the shelf.

##Research and Back Story

>The most important things to remember about back story are that (a) everyone has a history and (b) most of it isn’t very interesting. Stick to the parts that are, and don’t get carried away with the rest. Long life stories are best received in bars, and only then an hour or so before closing time, and if you are buying.

>Just don’t end up with the tail wagging the dog; remember that you are writing a novel, not a research paper. The story always comes first.

##Learning to Write

>You don’t need writing classes or seminars any more than you need this or any other book on writing.
