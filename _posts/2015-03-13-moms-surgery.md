I'm in the waiting room at Kaiser West LA.

I actually like hospitals because everyone working there is super nice, but I hate waiting rooms because they have the TV on. It's so annoying. How can people stand to have so much noise and pointless yammering drilled into their heads all the time?

I've been trying to understand the heap implementation of the priority queue. There are a few things I understand better, like how it's only partially sorted. How did people come up with this stuff? Grammar in spoken languages is complex, but nobody sat down and wrote it out.

~48 hours until my data structures final. I want to make sure I actually understand this stuff. It'll actually be useful. I've never studied this much for exams. And I have two big assignments due Sunday at midnight, one in each class. I want to get started on both of them today but I don't think I'm going to be able to do much on a 13" screen.

But at least I can write. It's therapeutic. 

What was I gonna complain about next? I forgot, the TV distracted me.

The surgeon said that everything went smoothly, which is great news considering how difficult a procedure it was. We're going to have to wait a couple weeks on the pathology labs.

My mom felt like crap when she came out of anesthesia, but the nurses said she was ok to go home so luckily we didn't have to stay long. It's pretty amazing that you can remove an entire bodily system in less than eight hours. I mean we checked in at 6:30am and started driving home at 2:30pm. I love modern medicine.

I was talking to my aunt about this actually. I can't wrap my head around the idea that you would want to live in a previous era in history. My mom just got operated on by a robot! We're living in the future!
