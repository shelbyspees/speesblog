Lisa said I don't seem depressed. And I don't feel as depressed. At least not today.

I've been super tired all week from my schedule. This is what it looks like (Monday through Friday):

I haven't even done a proper week like this yet. I only did Monday through Wednesday last week at my internship because of the holiday. But between the Christmas Even insanity at the restaurant and the stress of onboarding my first couple days at my internship, I came home on Wednesday completely wiped.

So maybe since I worked so much and then immediately took time to enjoy myself on my days off, it's a lot more rewarding than my previous situation, where I'd do nothing all week and be stressed out on the weekend.

Oh yeah, I'm not working weekends anymore. Seriously, can you blame me? Plus I start school next week. Frick, man.

Hopefully I can phase out my serving shifts soon. It won't be easy, but I need to keep looking forward. I'm still a loser, but this is the least loser-like I've felt all year.
