I left my tablet charging at work. Had to crack open an [actual physical book](http://www.amazon.com/The-Leadership-Challenge-4th-Edition/dp/0787984922) to read before bed.

Learning to lead is about discovering what you care about and value.

* How certain am I of my own conviction about the vision and values?
* What gives me the courage to continue in the face of uncertainty and adversity?
* How will I handle disappointments, mistakes, and setbacks?
* What are my strengths and weaknesses?
* What do I need to do to improve my abilities to move the organization forward?
* How solid is my relationship with my constituents?
* How can I keep myself motivated and encouraged?
* What keeps me from giving up?
* Am I the right one to be leading at this very moment? Why?
* How much do I understand about what is going on in the organization and the world in which it operates?
* How prepared am I to handle the complex problems that now confront my organization?
* What are my beliefs about how people ought to conduct the affairs of our organization?
* Where do I think the organization ought to be headed over the next ten years?
