I've been thinking a lot lately about representations of women in mainstream media.

I can't sleep now anyway so I might as well expand on this a bit.

This started a few weeks ago when I read something that made me really angry. To protect the accused I won't go into detail here, but suffice to say that you CANNOT CARRY A GUN THERE. (Although [this guy](http://www.articlesuponarticles.com/2014/06/handcuffed-man-pulls-out-gun-from-butt-crack-shoots-at-officers/) seems to prove me wrong.)

This post may end up turning into me drooling over *[Avatar: Legend of Korra](http://www.nick.com/legend-of-korra/episodes/)*. Just a warning.

##What were they thinking?

Last year Marvel hired [Milo Manara](http://www.milomanara.it/), the erotic artist, to draw cover art for some of their mainstream comics. This was a really stupid decision. You can read more about it [here](http://io9.com/check-out-spider-woman-1-starring-spider-womans-ass-1624535918), since they phrased it better than I can.

You don't hire erotic artists to create mainstream comic art, just like you don't hire porn cameramen to film your wedding.

And what do you get when you hire an erotic artist to make cover art? Erotic cover art that pisses off your fans. You can see Spider-Woman pictured on the left below. On the right is a male superhero in the same position.

Other complaints:

- Where are her clothes?? She's literally wearing body paint.
- Where are her muscles? Even nerdtastic Peter Parker got buff from jumping around from building to building all the time. At that super low body fat percentage on Spider-Woman you're bound to see some muscle definition, especially when she's literally wearing body paint.

To make myself feel better I cover up her gross pouty face and pretend that she's trying to fart in the general direction of someone who insulted her. Because that's what this picture deserves.

[The Hawkeye Initiative](http://thehawkeyeinitiative.com/) is a Tumblr account that brilliantly depicts male superheroes in the same poses and outfits as female ones. Whatever you're doing, drop it and spend twenty minutes scrolling through that Tumblr. 

<a href="http://thehawkeyeinitiative.com/"><img class="wide" src="http://36.media.tumblr.com/67ede2b797b7be380fe42953fdd1e8bc/tumblr_mu4kutf7c71rr5ii2o1_500.jpg"/></a>

[This article on Marvel's female superhero renaissance](http://www.vulture.com/2015/05/marvels-female-superhero-renaissance.html?mid=twitter_nymag) discusses how the internet allows fans to communicate their interests to creators while also connecting content to wider audiences.

>Once online communities began to rally female fans together, it was only a matter of time before publishers realized they existed in numbers large enough to sway the entire market.

I mean, would they be making *[Ms. Marvel](http://marvel.com/comics/issue/49089/ms_marvel_2014_1)* about a Muslim teenage girl if they weren't sure they'd have readers? Shit, I think I'm gonna become a member to support the cause.

The article linked above expresses better than I can how frustrating it is to try to relate to female characters in comics. It's pretty common in most media actually.

>One particularly irritating trope became ubiquitous: female characters being maimed, raped, and mangled in service of a male character’s plot. In the 1990s, comics writer Gail Simone gave this phenomenon the term “women in refrigerators,” referencing a 1994 Green Lantern story in which Green Lantern comes home to find his girlfriend’s mutilated remains stuffed inside his fridge.

But I don't want to get too much into characterization and plot. Today I'm just here to talk about representations of women's bodies. 







##The Avatar Universe

I am a fan. Just putting that out there.

I'm going to start with a discussion of Korra. The show starts when she's 16, so she's going to be young and pretty. She's also been training in the bending disciplines since she was a child, so she's definitely fit.

The creators of Avatar actually do a great job of drawing the characters to reflect their talents. Mako (below, in the back) is a firebender so he's not going to need the kind of muscle mass that Bolin (in the front) has as an earthbender.

<img class="wide" src="http://images.latintimes.com/sites/latintimes.com/files/2014/01/17/legend-korra.jpg
"/>

Firebending requires agility. Since you can't really block with fire, dodging becomes an important skill. Earthbending, on the other hand, requires stability. As the great Toph Beifong phrased it:


>"Rock is a stubborn element. If you're going to move it, you've gotta be like a rock yourself."

The reason why I bring this up is because it's important to consider how to approach the muscularity of an avatar. Each bending discipline requires developing different muscle groups and different instincts, similar to how different sports produce very different looking bodies in their athletes.

Pictured below, second on the right is Connie Price-Smith, olympic shot-put athlete.

Throwing around heavy shit builds solid muscle from top to bottom. Her body is pretty similar to Korra's, actually.


Tai Lee is an interesting example of body design. An olympic-level gymnast and circus performer, she should have crazy core strength. Instead she's given soft breasts and a tiny waist.

<img class="wide" src="http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20150215160824/avatar/es/images/9/91/Ty_Lee_encantadora.png"/>

When I think about Tai Lee's muscle-to-weight ratio I'm not sure if it adds up.

<img class="wide" src="http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/24900000/ty-lee-ty-lee-mai-zuko-and-azula-24947567-736-552.jpg"/>

Above it's clear she does have muscle in her legs.

<img class="wide" src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/1/1f/Ty_Lee's_acrobatics.png/revision/latest?cb=20140908142129"/>

I guess the closest athlete to her body type would be a cheerleader, which actually matches her perky personality. See the similarities in her core, hips, and legs:

Although these aerial performers also have similar legs and arms to Tai Lee:

<img class="wide" src="http://misslife.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cirque1a.jpg"/>

I'm going to conclude that Tai Lee is blessed with curves.

What's also interesting is how the shows' creators chose to dress these athletic women and girls.

<img class="wide" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fb/Katara.png"/>

Fourteen-year-old Katara is the first voice you hear every time you watch an episode of *Avatar: The Last Airbender*:

>"Water. Earth. Fire. Air. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked..."

Katara is the first named character in the entire show as well as the first named bender.

At the South Pole, Katara obviously has to layer:

<img class="wide" src="http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/26800000/Katara-katara-26887951-720-480.png"/>

But later in the show she's forced to wear Fire Nation clothes so we get to see her body a bit more.

<img class="wide" src="http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/21500000/Katara-katara-21593396-700-700.png"/>

This is actually something fourteen-year-old me would have wanted to wear. And to go back to athletic body types, I feel like Katara has similar agility and strength to a volleyball player:

<img class="wide" src="http://www.scottgoold.org/images/issues/jaqueline.jpg"/>

And these high school volleyball uniforms actually look like something she'd wear:

<img class="wide" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/High_school_women_volleyball_07.jpg"/>

Considering the lack of technical athletic wear fabric in the show at the time, Katara's outfits are pretty damn practical.

Speaking of technical fabrics, let's talk about airbender suits.

<img class="wide" src="https://mlpforums.com/uploads/monthly_10_2014/blogentry-8039-0-80388500-1412407938.png"/>

This is how you do form-fitting clothes. Aerodynamics. I don't think I need to expand on this.

Now back to Korra.

<img class="wide" src="https://chicgeekspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/b4-trailer-099.png"/>

She's strong, athletic, practical, low-maintenance, stubborn, loves to fight. She has an attitude, an appetite, and a sense of humor.

I love how muscular she is. Honestly she's my #fitspo. I could look like her if I built up a load of muscle and ended up around 160lbs.

<img class="wide" src="http://emertainmentmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/korra.png"/>

You can see that she has a really solid torso, but her hips are still relatively soft. She probably doesn't have visible abs.

Why are her boobs so big? Genetics, plus her body fat percentage. She's constantly active and training (plus I'm sure she never experienced self-consciousness about her body growing up) so she has to have a super healthy appetite. She also has a ton of upper-body strength which will make her chest bigger as well.

<img class="wide" src="http://www.cinemablend.com/images/sections/67870/The_Legend_of_Korra_67870.jpg"/>

Omg those arms.

Also, while she's definitely gorgeous, the show's creators don't hide it when she's not feeling gorgeous.

God, she kicks so much ass. I love Korra so much. I wish I had had a Korra in my life 20 years ago.

Does it make sense why this is important?
