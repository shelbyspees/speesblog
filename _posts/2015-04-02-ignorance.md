I've been reading and making notes on [<i class="fa fa-book"></i> *Apprenticeship Patterns*](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/index.html) by Dave Hoover and Adewale Oshineye.

When I read books like this, there are several ways I can approach it. Sometimes I'll just read the book straight through, but I'll usually highlight and make notes as I read. I'm doing that right now with [<i class="fa fa-book"></i> *Working with Emotional Intelligence*](). 

Another way I'll approach a book is by breaking it down into an outline or summary. You can see how I did that with [my post on <i class="fa fa-book"></i> *Solving the Procrastination Puzzle*]() as well as my [book review on <i class="fa fa-book"></i> *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People*](). This is also a useful way to approach my reading for school.

My favorite way, the most time-consuming, is to treat it like a workbook. Most of these non-fiction self-improvement books I read have questions or exercises for each chapter. I have a whole notebook in Evernote dedicated to all the questions in [<i class="fa fa-book"></i> *Becoming a Technical Leader*](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B004J4VV3I/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title), pictured below.

Obviously I haven't bothered to answer most of them yet. I did say this approach is time-consuming.

I spent several months in the fall of 2013 doing the deep soul-searching that *7 Habits* demands of its readers. Someday soon I hope to dig out those (physical) notebooks and post my results.

So when I came across these two sections in the "Emptying the Cup" chapter of *Apprenticeship Patterns*, I knew they'd make a great post here. I'm still working on my summary outline, but it's never too soon to delve deep in these topics.

The following quoted section is from my summary notes.

>###Expose Your Ignorance
>
>You're being paid to know what you're doing and people depend on you to deliver, but you're not familiar with all the required technologies.
>
>Solution:
>
>- Let them see you grow
>- The learning process is part of delivering software
>- Build your reputation on your learning ability rather than what you already know
>- Ask questions
>- Identify areas of ignorance and work to reduce them
>
>Action:
>
>- Write down a list of five things you don't understand about your work
>- Put the list where others can see it
>- Refresh the list as your work changes

<h3 class="" id="list">The List</h3>

Uh oh. This is the hard part.

**1\. I don't really get how web applications send and receive data.** I get the high-level HTTP verbs and status codes (thanks in part to [this REST API tutorial](http://www.restapitutorial.com/)), and I mostly get why MVC is commonly used as a design, but I don't get where the actual data happens.

Is it all just arbitrary? Users are objects? Tweets are objects? This is something I can probably get a much better handle on once I finish [<i class="fa fa-book"></i> *The Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](https://www.railstutorial.org/book) and build a simple Twitter clone.

**2\. Even though I got an A in Data Structures, I feel like I don't have a strong handle on how to implement them.** I also feel like I should be able to implement them in a language like Java where I can make use of OOP principles.

**3\. I have pathetically little knowledge of when and where to use JavaScript.** From what I can tell, you can do almost anything in JavaScript. I should be learning it this quarter in Web Development, and there are a ton of resources for picking it up.

I think I'm being too hard on myself about things I've had no exposure to. Of course I don't know when to use Javascript. I only just figured out when to use CSS. I need to give myself time.

I'm putting all this pressure on myself because I'm graduating next year but that won't be the end of my learning. Right now I'm building my foundation and from there I'll develop as an apprentice.

**4\. How to get involved in open source.** I don't think I have any applicable skills though. I guess I can go through and proofread the documentation. I may learn a lot from that, but I feel like I can learn more from actual coding. And this conflict right here is what gets me stuck.

**5\. How to come up with solutions to technical problems.** This is probably just another area where my lack of experience is at fault. The more I learn about computers and software, the more I'll learn about the ways people solve their problems. I don't have a problem doing research. I'm just overwhelmed by everything I have yet to learn.

This quoted section is also from my summary notes.

>###Confront Your Ignorance
>
>There are gaps in your skillset that affect your daily work, but you don't know how to begin mastering these tools and techniques, especially since others assume you already have the knowledge.
>
>Solution:
>
>- Pick one skill/tool/technique and learn it
>- Find the best approach for you
>- When you reach a certain level of ability, decide whether to move on to a new gap in your skillset
>
>Action:
>
>- Strive to learn each of the things from the [Expose Your Ignorance action list](#list)
>- You may notice new gaps in your knowledge, so be sure to add these to the list

So I guess I'll be revisiting this topic in the future.
