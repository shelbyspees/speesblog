I've been reading and making notes on [<i class="fa fa-book"></i> *Apprenticeship Patterns*](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/index.html) by Dave Hoover and Adewale Oshineye.

When I read books like this, there are several ways I can approach it. Sometimes I'll just read the book straight through, but I'll usually highlight and make notes as I read. I'm doing that right now with [*Working with Emotional Intelligence*](). 

Another way I'll approach a book is by breaking it down into an outline or summary. You can see how I did that with [my post on *Solving the Procrastination Puzzle*]() as well as my [book review on *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People*](). This is also a useful way to approach my reading for school.

My favorite way, the most time-consuming, is to treat it like a workbook. Most of these non-fiction self-improvement books I read have questions or exercises for each chapter. I have a whole notebook in Evernote dedicated to all the questions in [*Becoming a Technical Leader*](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B004J4VV3I/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title), pictured below.

Obviously I haven't bothered to answer most of them yet. I did say this approach is time-consuming.

I spent several months in the fall of 2013 doing the deep soul-searching that *7 Habits* demands of its readers. Someday soon I hope to dig out those (physical) notebooks and post my results.

So when I came across these two sections in the "Emptying the Cup" chapter of *Apprenticeship Patterns*, I knew they'd make a great post here. I'm still working on my summary outline, but it's never too soon to delve deep in these topics.
