The gist is that basically anything worth doing is going to kind of suck at some point. Getting a beach bod requires diet and exercise. Getting perfect grades requires dedicated study. Building a business from scratch requires a shit ton of hard work.

For example, I love eating. I don't love cooking. I haven't made a habit of planning meals. Sometimes I think it'd be easier if I could skip entire days. Lately my appetite has been pretty weak so it doesn't bother me as much. 

When my bingeing was bad and my brain closely associated hunger with despair, it was a lot harder for me to skip meals. Accuse me of anorexia all you want, but now I finally feel like my body will let me relax when it comes to food. We (Americans/Westerners) already eat way too much. I'm 20lbs overweight. The real issue is nutrition anyway.

Back to my point. If I really cared about being healthy and feeling good about my body, I'd put the effort in to planning my meals, buying groceries, preparing food every day. We're supposed to cook every day, just like we're supposed to exercise and socialize and learn and sleep every day.

This is what Stephen Covey referred to as "sharpening the saw," the 7th habit in [The 7 Habits](http://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Anniversary-ebook/dp/B00GOZV3TM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1413354191&sr=8-1&keywords=7+habits+of+highly+effective+people). It's also related to the 3rd habit, "put first things first," which teaches a variety of time management that aligns with urgent and non-urgent goals.

The easy stuff doesn't build character. And the hard stuff isn't even that hard.
