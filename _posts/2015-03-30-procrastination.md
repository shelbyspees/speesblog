Today I finished [<i class="fa fa-book"></i> *Solving the Procrastination Puzzle*](http://www.amazon.com/Solving-Procrastination-Puzzle-Concise-Strategies/dp/B00JGAY5II/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=8-1&qid=1427829996) (the audiobook) by Tim Pychyl, and now I'm going through the text version to really dig out those actionable nuggets. 

It's a short listen/read but Pychyl does a great job of packing these condensed bits of information so you can use them right away. As a fan of his [podcast]() I know he's done his research, but Pychyl knows his audience. He didn't mess around. He wants you to **just get started.**

##Solving The Procrastination Puzzle

###<i class="fa fa-star"></i> All procrastination is delay, but not all delay is procrastination.

Procrastination is *needless voluntary delay*.

Task: reading for school   
Feeling: I already made some progress. It's not urgent right now.

Task: job applications  
Feeling: My application isn't strong enough. I don't know what to say. I need to work on projects and solidify my knowledge. I'm not ready to interview

Task: assignments   
Feeling: I'll be fine when I get to it. I have plenty of time.

 

###<i class="fa fa-star"></i> Procrastination is failing to get on with life itself.

People who score high in self-reports of procrastination also self-report lower achievement overall, more negative feelings, and even significantly more health problems.

When we procrastinate on our goals, we are our own worst enemy. We only have a finite amount of time to live.

####Task: reading for school

Costs of procrastination:

- less likely to complete reading
- less prepared for exams
- lowered self-respect
- less prepared for career
- STRESS

Benefits of timely action:

- more likely to complete reading
- more knowledgeable
- improved ability to parse technical writing
- pride
- plants seeds for future ideas

####Task: job applications

Costs of procrastination:

- STRESS
- less likely to get job
- possibly spend summer doing nothing
- resume stays empty

Benefits of timely action:

- worst case: they say no
- potentially find great opportunity, leading to knowledge, skills, resume, career advancement
- practice interviewing

 

###<i class="fa fa-star"></i> I won't give in to feel good. Feeling good now comes at a cost.

We want to feel good now and we will do whatever it takes for immediate mood repair, usually at the expense of long-term goals.

*Task aversiveness:* feeling negative emotions when facing a task we intend to do but do not want to. Emotions include: 

- frustration
- anger
- boredom
- resentment
- depression
- anxiety
- guilt

*Suck it up.* The first step at the moment of procrastination is to stay put.

**IF** I feel negative emotions when I face the task at hand, **THEN** I will stay put. (rather than stop, put it off, or run away)

The above if-then statement is called an [*implementation intention*](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/dont-delay/201001/implementation-intentions-facilitate-action-control), and Pychyl has done his research. These work great for replacing old habits with new, better ones. When I eventually revisit [<i class="fa fa-book"></i> *The Power of Habit*](http://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business-ebook/dp/B0055PGUYU/ref=sr_1_1_twi_2_kin?ie=UTF8&qid=1427831871&sr=8-1&keywords=the+power+of+habit) I'll probably talk about these again.

 

###<i class="fa fa-star"></i> I won't feel more like doing it tomorrow.

We have a bias when we predict future mood (affective) states in relation to positive or negative events.

*Focalism:* the tendency to underestimate the extent to which other events will influence our thoughts and feelings in the future.

*Presentism:* the tendency to put too much emphasis on the present in our prediction of the future.

We need to represent the future as though it were happening in the present. (But beware second-order procrastination, overplanning)

Expect to be wrong and deal with it.

><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> My current motivational state does not need to match my intention in order to act. <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i>

Expect that you will not feel overly enthused to get started when the time comes.

 

###<i class="fa fa-star"></i> I need to be aware of my rationalizations.

Tendency to:

1. discount future events in relation to short-term rewards
2. underestimate the time things will take and overestimate how much we can do
3. prefer tomorrow over today
4. self-handicap to protect self-esteem
5. think irrationally about the task at hand and our ability to accomplish that task
6. manufacture our own happiness by changing our thinking to be consistent with our behavior
