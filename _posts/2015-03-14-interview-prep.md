This is one way to prepare for behavioral interviews. It's not the best way, but I like it.

Employment is a relationship, and the interview is like your first date. You want to make sure you'll have things to talk about, and you don't want to pretend to be someone you're not if you actually want things to work out.

It's unfortunate that interviews cause such a skewed power relationship between the interviewer and interviewee. Each party should be scrutinizing the other to determine if they're going to work well together.

An interview is not an exam. It's a business meeting. I encourage that you come prepared with notes. It shows that you're thoughtful and thorough.

I recommend taking an hour to write down some information for each section the night before or day of your interview.














<h3 class="anchor" id="talking-points">Talking points</h3>

This is an abbreviated list of skills and accomplishments you want the interviewer to hear about. One good example can often be used to respond to a multitude of interview questions, since many interview questions have overlapping purposes.

This list is mostly going to be pulled from your resume, but if you're switching careers or you have interesting experience in other industries that might not be on your resume, feel free to talk about them too. For example, when applying to my current internship

Consider the position you're interviewing for and the person you'll be speaking to when listing these talking points. 

Common questions are all over the internet, but I'll list the ones you should definitely be prepared to answer.

- Tell me about yourself
- Strengths, and how they've helped you
- Weaknesses, and how you've benefitted by working to overcome them
- Describe a time you had difficulty working with a coworker
- Describe your biggest mistake
- Describe your ideal workplace
- Why do you want this job

These are the things you should have learned when you researched the company.

- Products
- Market share
- Number of employees
- Mission statement
- News











<h3 class="anchor" id="questions-to-ask">Questions to ask</h3>

I've actually had interviews where the interviewer forgot to ask me if I had any questions. And I came prepared with questions.

I'll link to a few places I've gotten inspiration from:

***Do you have any questions or doubts about me that I can help clear up?***

I usually ask this one last.

I like asking this question because usually if the interviewer likes you, they'll give the reasons why they like you to cushion anything potentially negative they might say. By doing this, they remind themselves of all the good things about you as the interview comes to a close while also giving you a chance to improve any negative perceptions they might have or fill them in on something you failed to mention.

This question also shows that you try to be aware of your shortcomings. Interviewers love modest job applicants, especially for entry-level positions. Plus, asking for feedback actually shows more confidence than strutting around like the king of the jungle.

You should already have all [these](https://www.themuse.com/advice/6-questions-that-will-ease-your-mind-before-the-interview) questions answered before you even start preparing:

- Who will I be meeting with?
- Is there anything I should know about the format of the interview?
- About how long can I expect it to last?
- Is there anything I should bring?
- Is there anything I should know about getting there or parking?
- What's the office dress code?

I'll make a separate post about interview outfits.

Watch this Amy Cuddy TED talk:

Use some of the techniques to boost your testosterone before the interview. I know I struggle with posture, so I try to take up more space in my every day life in order to make a habit of sitting up straighter.

Consider lifting weights the night before. I always stand up straighter and walk more firmly after doing squats. Exercise also promotes bloodflow to the pre-frontal cortex, helping you stay calm under pressure.

Sing in the shower to warm up your voice and put you in a good mood. I swear, it's important. This one is always a good energy boost:
