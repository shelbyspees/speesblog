This is one way to prepare for behavioral interviews. It's not the best way, but I like it.

Employment is a relationship, and the interview is like your first date. You want to make sure you'll have things to talk about, and you don't want to pretend to be someone you're not if you actually want things to work out.

It's unfortunate that interviews cause such a skewed power relationship between the interviewer and interviewee. Each party should be scrutinizing the other to determine if they're going to work well together.

An interview is not an exam. It's a business meeting. I encourage that you come prepared with notes. It shows that you're thoughtful and thorough.

I recommend taking an hour to write down some information for each section the night before or day of your interview.

<h3 class="anchor" id="talking-points">Talking points</h3>

This is an abbreviated list of skills and accomplishments you want the interviewer to hear about. One good example can often be used to respond to a multitude of interview questions, since many interview questions have overlapping purposes.

This list is mostly going to be pulled from your resume, but if you're switching careers or you have interesting experience in other industries that might not be on your resume, feel free to talk about them too. 

For example, when applying to software developer internships I left my experience teaching in Japan off my resume, but when talking to recruiters and interviewers I often tell them anecdotes about how I'd make sure my students understood the material while also keeping them entertained and correcting their mistakes. This demonstrates that I communicate decently well, I can juggle multiple ideas in my head at a time, and I'm not miserable to work with. So my talking point would look like this:

>- Teaching in Japan

But my response in the interview would expand on it a lot more.

The point of this isn't about having notes to read off of. It's about mapping your experience to the questions you anticipate being asked. 

I'm having you write it down because otherwise it won't happen. You tell yourself you can match up these questions and answers in your head, but you'll go into the interview and freeze. The notes are a prop. Or a lucky charm. They're not exactly necessary, but you don't want to go in without them.

Consider the position you're interviewing for and the person you'll be speaking to when listing these talking points. 

Common questions are all over the internet, but I'll list the ones you should definitely be prepared to answer.

- Tell me about yourself
- Strengths, and how they've helped you
- Weaknesses, and how you've benefitted by working to overcome them
- Describe a time you had difficulty working with a coworker
- Describe your biggest mistake
- Describe your ideal workplace
- Explain why you want this job

How does your experience map to these questions? Do you have any honest-to-goodness gaps? Like, you've never had difficulty working with a coworker? Think about why that is. Come up with something helpful to say for that question.

Also, it's less about answering the question word-for-word and more about letting the interviewer discover what kind of person you are. So for the "difficulty with a coworker" question you can just talk about a disagreement on some decision that had to be made. It doesn't have to be dramatic. Honestly, drama is kind of a negative in this case.











<h3 class="anchor" id="facts-about-company">Facts about the company, your interviewer, and the department/team/project</h3>

These are the things you should have learned when you researched the company:

- Products
- Market share
- Number of employees
- Mission statement
- News

You don't have to write down all of them, but they're good question-fodder.

How in-depth you research will depend on the kind of job you're applying for. Interns and entry-level applicants may find the

I've actually had interviews where the interviewer forgot to ask me if I had any questions. And I came prepared with questions.

Depending on the interview you may not have time for many questions, but it's always good to come with extras. Usually if the interviewer does a good job of introducing themselves, talking about the company, and explaining the position, a lot of your questions will be answered. But you should have a couple more. Make sure they're appropriate to the position you're applying for and your areas of expertise.

***Can I ask why you have an opening for this position?***

They'll probably say they're reorganizing or expanding or whatever. They may say that the previous person moved on to a new role. I like this question because you learn about the interviewer's communication style. Like, do they communicate what's going on at the company you're applying to work at.

***Can you tell me more about the people I'll be working with directly?***

This is crucial. Your team and immediate manager will make or break your experience at the company.

They should tell you at which point in the application process you'll be able to meet the team. If you're lucky, it's when you ask this question.

***Can you give me a tour of the office?***

I've actually never asked this because I've never had enough leverage to choose between offers based on the office environment. I definitely hope to get there someday.

A farm of grey cubicles is generally a red flag. Otherwise, only you know what kind of working environment is best for you.

***What kind of person are you looking for to fill this role?***

Some people don't approve of this question, but it'll tell you if there's anything they want that you definitely cannot provide. Saves both of you a lot of time.

More generally, it'll give you a opportunity to address each aspect of the position that you're qualified for. They say, "Well we're looking for someone with XYZ experience" and you say, "Well as you know, I've worked on several XYZ projects."

***How do you like it here?***

Hopefully they give you a mini-history of their time at the company. From here you can ask why they chose this company and any other questions that come up.

***Can you tell me more about how this company got started/got into X industry?***

I recently went to a career fair and I found this was a great question to ask recruiters. You learn about how the company found its niche in the industry and how strongly the employees feel about the mission. This is when I started realizing how much I'm interested in the business side of software.

***Do you have any questions or doubts about me that I can help clear up?***

I usually ask this one last.

I like asking this question because usually if the interviewer likes you, they'll give the reasons why they like you to cushion anything potentially negative they might say. By doing this, they remind themselves of all the good things about you as the interview comes to a close while also giving you a chance to improve any negative perceptions they might have or fill them in on something you failed to mention.

This question also shows that you try to be aware of your shortcomings. Interviewers love modest job applicants, especially for entry-level positions. Plus, asking for feedback actually shows more confidence than strutting around like the king of the jungle.

You should already have all [these](https://www.themuse.com/advice/6-questions-that-will-ease-your-mind-before-the-interview) questions answered before you even start preparing:

- Who will I be meeting with?
- Is there anything I should know about the format of the interview?
- About how long can I expect it to last?
- Is there anything I should bring?
- Is there anything I should know about getting there or parking?
- What's the office dress code?

I'll make a separate post about interview outfits.

Watch this Amy Cuddy TED talk:

Use some of the techniques to boost your testosterone before the interview. I know I struggle with posture, so I try to take up more space in my every day life in order to make a habit of sitting up straighter.

Consider lifting weights the night before. I always stand up straighter and walk more firmly after doing squats. Exercise also promotes bloodflow to the pre-frontal cortex, helping you stay calm under pressure.

Sing in the shower to warm up your voice and put you in a good mood. I swear, it's important. This one is always a good energy boost:
