Here's how I write my cover letters. 

I won't claim that it's the best way, but it's the way I write them after spending the past four years reading every job application advice article I came across. I spent a lot of time at Career Services. You should see my Evernote.

>Dear [hiring manager],
>
>Thank you for taking the time to read my application.
>
>I am applying for the Software Engineer position as advertised on Indeed.com. I hope to [improve some aspect of the business] using my [concrete skills expanded on below] experience.
>
>- [Verb]ed [technical thing] [positive effect with numbers]
>- Refactored [something] to improve maintainability, eliminating 25% of the code base by removing unnecessary code
>- Implemented [cool feature/project] using [language] [framework/tool] (this is probably what you're going to say)
>
>Feel free to browse my projects at [Github link/landing page], and you can reach me at [email] if you have any questions.
>
>Please let me know about the next step in the application process. I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
>
>Best,  
>[name]

This demonstrates the following:

- You accomplished technical things with a positive result
- You want to contribute to what the company specializes in
- You can communicate the above to a business person
