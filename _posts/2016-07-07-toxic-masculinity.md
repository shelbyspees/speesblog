title: Toxic Masculinity

Steven T. Asma posted a timely, comprehensive [essay](https://aeon.co/essays/humiliation-and-rage-how-toxic-masculinity-fuels-mass-shootings) a few weeks ago in June. I'd like to lean on Asma's quality writing to explore my own thoughts about where toxic masculinity flourishes and how to end it.

Men and women are almost exactly the same. We are way more alike than we'll ever be different. But we are raised differently and treated differently and have very different life experiences worldwide. The small biological and less small sociocultural differences in men intermingle and create the potential for toxic masculinity.

This post is about men. The majority of violent crime is committed by men. The majority of rape is committed by men. The majority of domestic abuse is performed by men. The majority of active shooter scenarios have men as the assailant.

I truly believe that everybody in this world is capable of good. Nearly everybody in this world wants to live peacefully and be happy. Very very few people will go out of their way to be violent toward others.

But there's something in the way many societies socialize men. It combines with their natural brain chemistry to create a mindset fertile for the seeds of toxic, violent thoughts.

For the scope of this post, I'm criticizing the behavior of many men. I'm also thinking of men as the victims here. They suffer under the burden of toxic masculinity along with the rest of us.

Men would be better off without toxic masculinity. And the world would definitely be better off.

## The Loser

## Resentment

> Envy and resentment are powerful in social animals, and while they might eventually scale up to social contracts, they are not moral per se.

Later in the essay, Asma 

> The weaponised loser tries to make sense of his emotions by supplying causal stories and moral judgments about why he doesn’t have the sexual satisfactions, wealth or status that he expects.

Toxic communities prey on these men, feeding them scapegoats and baiting them with promises of retribution:

> A few well-chosen pugilistic Quran quotes and homophobic or misogynistic slogans can rile up a resentful male to all kinds of evil. The wellspring of this evil is not in the religion, nor even the economic conditions, or the socially constructed patriarchy, but in profound, implacable resentment.

Scapegoating is a common theme among objectively evil organizations like ISIS and the Klu Klux Klan as well as in other corrupt movements like GamerGate, 

American culture was built on kicking people while they're down. Our 500 year history of oppression 

## Rage

> The frustrated male casts about for a ‘cause’ of his misery, and mistakes the increasing power of newly emancipated communities for his depletion.


> The lone shooter who feels repeatedly humiliated at what he perceives as the visible success of others – the emancipation of women; the social acceptance of [LGBT] people; the integration of refugees – feels like his very identity is being broken and degraded. Rage promises to retake the situation and correct his perverse moral landscape.


The loser's feeling of injustice begets a warped sense of justice: only after those *below* him are brought down to their level will he be in his rightful place atop the Privilege Pedestal.

> [W]hat happens when our tantrums don’t grow up, don’t transmogrify into healthy impulses and norms of justice? Adult tantrums, filled with resentment, and facilitated by weapons, become tragedies in the order of the Orlando shooting.


## Unteaching violence

> [I]t is not enough to simply label lone-wolf shooters and other malefactors as ‘mentally ill’. Toxic maleness, and the specific hydraulics of hate are grounded in originally adaptive biological structures, which need cultural management to find healthy expression.

It is our responsibility as a society to rehabilitate these frustrated, resentful, potentially violent losers.

> Every human society has contended with the challenge of containing and redirecting male frustration and rage

As opposed to the unhealthy body image taught by most mainstream conservative religious communities, the mindfulness valued in Buddhism provides skills for overcoming frustration and resentment:

> Detaching from resentment, and noticing its natural impermanence, is a way to attain some freedom over such enslaving passions.

Redirection provides another option:

> In contemporary life, many young men channel aggression, resentment and unspent libido into hours of online gaming.

Currently, the online gaming community is probably the last place we want frustrated, angry young men. But they're already there, so hopefully it's doing something. Plus, video games are a medium with enormous creative potential. There are game developers creating wonderful alternatives to the repetitive first-person shooters we see year after year.

<aside>The people who perform the majority of harassment in online games are those who suck at the games. It's a self-defense mechanism. (see also: )</aside>

Any issue with violent video games is beyond the scope of this post, though.

Traditionally, sports have been an outlet for unspent energy and frustration:

> Athletic sport remains a more promising redirect for excess libido, competitiveness and surplus energy – after all, George Orwell referred to international sport as ‘war minus the shooting’ – and even the sublimated violence of sport occasionally boils over into outright aggression, especially among hyper-aroused male fans.



> Finally, besides accommodation and redirection of frustration, it might be possible to reduce resentment by engineering actual libido satisfactions

People much more knowledgeable than me can discuss the effects that widespread access to online pornography has had on young men.

## Misogyny and Homophobia
