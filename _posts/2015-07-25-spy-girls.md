On that long drive home the other day I had a bit of a realization. I've do have a dream. I do have an image of how I want to be when I grow up.
  
It looks like this:

I read a ton as a kid, but these cheesy-ass books had my attention for years. I read them over and over. 

I always wanted to be a spy, or a secret agent, or something of the sort. I had an imaginary friend in Australia with whom I'd Skype for hours (obviously long before Skype was a thing) discussing top-secret details of our mission. I had a secret imaginary touch-screen monitor that was hidden behind the wall next to my bed. Perfect for late-night briefings.

Little did I know how insecure video chat would be when it finally did get invented. Definitely don't want to be having top-secret meetings over Skype, imaginary or not.

So these ridiculously '90s books I repeatedly pored over really shaped me after I started reading them. All three of the main characters were ~19 year old women (girls, really) who get shipped around the world to complete confusing missions for the Tower, a secret organization apparently acting on behalf of the the United States government.

One of the characters, Caylin Pike, is an extreme athlete. Snowboarding, surfing, high-speed motorcycle chases---she can handle it all. She is also a master at stealth, sneaking in and out of rooms without notice (though all three girls have to sneak at one point or another).

The second main character, Theresa Hearth, is a master technologist. She makes light of cracking confidential CIA records and occasionally MacGyvers her way out of sticky situations. Her underdeveloped social skills occasionally make things difficult for the spy trio, but her computer skills are essential for nearly every mission.

The third spy girl, Jo Carreras, is fluent in a number of languages, including English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese. She's also a master of seduction, and her relentless boy-craziness gets in the way of the mission sometimes. But she uses her conceited fa√ßade to hide her painful past.

Hmm, trill-seeking athlete*? Awkward computer geek? Flirtatious linguist? Yeah, I wonder if there's any influence there.

Oh god I'm rereading the first few chapters and it's so painful. It's so painful. How did I even put up with this??? I guess elementary school Shelby had much lower standards than today's Shelby does.
  
I'm not even sure if the idea is better than the execution, at least in this example. I'd be afraid for the world if 19-year-old me were in charge of protecting it, thinking back to how super-mature I was at that age. /s

Anyway, it's fun to realize how much these books totally shaped my educational and career trajectory. Once a spy girl, always a spy girl, amirite?

...I just got really confused reading the book just now because it mentions *Pretty Little Liars* and Taylor Swift. Taylor Swift is my age, she wasn't famous when this was written back in the '90s, right? Then I realized it's the Kindle edition! They totally updated it for a modern audience. Super weird, man.

Note: Since I've been reading such a beautifully written book while attempting to write this post I hope you'll excuse that my style is extra-elegant today.

\*So while I probably seem like the least athletic person ever, I have tried out a lot more cool sports than the average person probably has:

- skiing
- snowboarding
- surfing
- scuba diving
- hiking/trekking
- mountain biking
- archery
- sport shooting
- riding a motorcycle
- riding an ATV

I haven't been good at most of them, especially since puberty, but I've definitely been exposed to number of outdoorsy and fairly exciting sports. It just takes practice, right? Maybe I'll become a surfer yet.
