I'm reading [*Apprenticeship Patterns*](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/index.html) by David H. Hoover and Adewale Oshineye. I love that it's available to read for free online. It really captures the mindset that makes certain learners significantly more successful than the majority.

In chapter 3, ["The Long Road"](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch03.html#the_long_road), there's a great quote about embracing the journey, the struggle to build that knowledge:

>For every step you take toward mastery, your destination moves two steps further away. Embrace mastery as a lifelong endeavor. Learn to love the journey.  
>--George Leonard, Mastery

This quote touches on quite a few clichés we've all encountered. ["You don't know what you don't know"](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/09/you-dont-know-what-you-dont-know-how.html), and as you start learning about the things you don't know you face this endless chasm of knowledge that you realize you'll never be able to wrap your head around. 

You can't let your confidence depend on being smart and knowledgeable. Not only is it impossible to be knowledgable about everything, but especially in software we get new things to learn every day. Even if the buzzwords being dropped are just a slight deviation from whatever web framework is flavor-of-the-week, you're still not going to know what they are the first time you hear them. And knowing isn't what makes you good.

Further, pretending to know things that you don't only slows you down. While I understand that it's insanely difficult to ask the right kinds of questions when first encountering 

No, knowledge isn't separates the wheat from the chaff in any industry, or in any aspect of life.

Sure, with experience comes expertise, but what's important about experience is that it results in maturity. 

- Making tiny course corrections
- Accepting (but not encouraging) ignorance
- Doing your best to 
- Maintaining self-awareness

Of course, we're human. And I'm expecting anyone bothering to read this is probably a huge nerd. We love being smart and we love showing other people that we're smart. We hate being dumb in front of other people, especially other smart people we admire. That's why I do recommend that you [retreat into competence](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch02.html#retreat_into_competence), as discussed in chapter 2 of *Apprenticeship Patterns*:

>**Problem**  
>As you are introduced to the vast reaches of your ignorance you are overwhelmed.
>
>**Solution**  
>Pull back, then launch forward like a stone from a catapult. Retreat briefly into your competence to regain your composure. Take some time to build something that you know how to build. Then use that experience to recognize how far you’ve come and how much you are currently capable of.

I do this all the time. That's what this blog is about. This is why I read books like [*Working with Emotional Intelligence*]() and random linguistics textbooks to procrastinate my schoolwork. When I'm overwhelmed by the hard stuff I'm trying to understand, retreating into what I'm good at helps me build my confidence 

Last year when I started my intro CS classes I committed to practicing violin every day. It was great, actually, and I ought to go back to doing it.
