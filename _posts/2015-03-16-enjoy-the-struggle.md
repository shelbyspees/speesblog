I'm reading [*Apprenticeship Patterns*](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/index.html) by David H. Hoover and Adewale Oshineye. I love that it's available to read for free online. It really captures the mindset that makes certain learners significantly more successful than the majority.

In chapter 3, ["The Long Road,"](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch03.html#the_long_road) there's a great quote about embracing the journey to build that knowledge:

>For every step you take toward mastery, your destination moves two steps further away. Embrace mastery as a lifelong endeavor. Learn to love the journey.  
>--George Leonard, Mastery

This quote touches on quite a few clichés we've all encountered. ["You don't know what you don't know,"](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/09/you-dont-know-what-you-dont-know-how.html) and as you start learning about the things you don't know, you find yourself facing this endless chasm of knowledge. To those who collect knowledge, it's overwhelming to think of all the things you'll never be able to wrap your head around. [(An example I encountered recently.)](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html)

You can't let your confidence depend on being smart and knowledgeable. Not only is it impossible to be knowledgable about everything, but we're going to continue to encounter new things to learn every day. Especially in software. Even if the buzzwords being dropped are just a slight deviation from whatever web framework is flavor-of-the-week, you're still not going to know what they mean the first time you hear them.

And dropping buzzwords isn't what makes you good.

Further, pretending to know things that you don't only slows you down. While I understand that it's insanely difficult to ask the right kinds of questions when first encountering a new subject, especially when you're interacting with experts, it's important to dig for information. 

Don't let your confidence depend on feeling smart. Your confidence should be fueled by your efforts.

As you get comfortable with not knowing, you'll find yourself getting better at asking [smart questions](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html). Actually, the real experts [ask the most questions](http://blog.codinghorror.com/are-you-an-expert/):

>Being an expert isn't telling other people what you know. It's understanding what questions to ask, and flexibly applying your knowledge to the specific situation at hand. Being an expert means providing sensible, highly contextual direction.

In that last post I just linked from Coding Horror, Jeff quotes James Bach's Google presentation on becoming a software testing expert. James phrases it like this:

>Level 0: I overcame obliviousness  
>Level 1: I overcame intimidation  
>Level 2: I overcame incoherence  
>Level 3: I overcame competence  

I have another way of phrasing this, and it's been something that's come up a lot as I learn more about software:

{% highlight c %}
10: PRINT "What's that?"  
20: PRINT "You can do that??"  
30: PRINT "Oh that's easy."  
40: GOTO  10 
{% endhighlight %}

No, pure knowledge isn't separates the wheat from the chaff in any industry, or in any aspect of life. The difference is attitude. As shown in my crappy Visual BASIC loop (I've never written a line of BASIC in my life), it's a never-ending cycle. The second you understand something, it introduces you to ten more things you've never heard of. It's incredibly easy to get overwhelmed, but the best learners and the real experts thrive on it.

Of course, we're human. And I'm expecting anyone bothering to read this is probably a huge nerd. We love being smart and we love showing other people that we're smart. We hate being dumb in front of other people, especially other smart people we admire. That's why I do recommend that you [retreat into competence](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch02.html#retreat_into_competence), as discussed in chapter 2 of *Apprenticeship Patterns*:

>**Problem**  
>As you are introduced to the vast reaches of your ignorance you are overwhelmed.
>
>**Solution**  
>Pull back, then launch forward like a stone from a catapult. Retreat briefly into your competence to regain your composure. Take some time to build something that you know how to build. Then use that experience to recognize how far you’ve come and how much you are currently capable of.

I do this all the time. That's what this blog is about. This is why I read books like [*Working with Emotional Intelligence*](http://www.amazon.com/Working-Emotional-Intelligence-Daniel-Goleman-ebook/dp/B000JMKTN2/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=8-1&qid=1426551915) and random linguistics textbooks to procrastinate my schoolwork. When I'm overwhelmed by the hard stuff I'm trying to understand, retreating into what I'm good at helps me build my confidence, which in turn allows me to climb back on that learning horse for a while longer.

As long as you're careful not to let yourself plateau, it's okay or even good to enjoy that competence for a while. That way you can brace yourself for that next bout of learning. According to Gerald Weinberg in his book [Becoming a Technical Leader](http://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Technical-Leader-Gerald-Weinberg-ebook/dp/B004J4VV3I/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=8-1&qid=1426553246), skill growth basically looks like this:

<img class="center" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/comp/skill1.png"/>

Your competence is in the low slopes of the plateau, and significant growth only comes after a period of struggle. You have to allow for a lower quality of work while you're learning, but once you acquire the skill your effectiveness will jump quite a bit. That is, until your competence in that plateaus.

Worry not, I highly doubt you could ever run out of things to learn.

So my advice is to learn to enjoy those little dips in your productivity. Each one is an investment in your future success. You'll cut down a tree if you don't stop [sharpening the saw]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-03-02-book-review-seven-habits %}#habit7), but trying to cut with a dull blade is nonsensical. There needs to be a balance between learning and doing.

It all comes down to being self-aware. Know your goal (a.k.a. ["begin with the end in mind"]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-03-02-book-review-seven-habits %}#habit2)), and adjust when you're not following whatever path will get you there. Accept that there will always be things you're ignorant of, but don't make that an excuse for encouraging ignorance. Do your best to continuously absorb information. I mean, I've learned a ton just from living on reddit for the past five years.

Above all, maintain that self-awareness. Awareness is always the first step.
