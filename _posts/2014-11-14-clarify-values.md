This is the first post in a series meant to summarize the principles of *[The Leadership Challenge](http://www.amazon.com/Leadership-Challenge-4th-James-Kouzes/dp/0787984914/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=8-2&qid=1415953746)* through direct quotations from the book. 

This is a personal project meant purely for educational purposes, and if any toes have been stepped on feel free to reach out to me on Twitter.

## Clarify Values

Among the most admired leaders, one quality stands out above all else: strong beliefs about matters of principle. Great leaders have unwavering commitment to a clear set of values. 

People admire those who believe strongly in something, and who are willing to stand up for their beliefs. You have to be honest with yourself in order to be honest with others. People won't follow you, or even pay attention to you, if you don't have strong beliefs.

To earn and sustain personal credibility, you must first be able to clearly articulate deeply held beliefs. You have to comprehend fully the deeply held beliefs--values, principles, standards, ethics, and ideals--that drive you.

The greater the clarity of, belief in, and passion for our personal standards of excellence, the greater the probabillity we'll act in concert with them.

### Find your voice

If the words you speak are not your words but someone else's, you will not, in the long term, be able to be consistent in word and deed. You will not have the integrity to lead.

***Explore your inner territory:*** Leadership begins with something that grabs hold of you and won't let go. You can only be authentic when you lead according to the principles that matter most to you.

***Values guide us:*** The clearer we are about our values, the easier it is to stay on the path we've chosen. Values set the parameters for the hundreds of decisions we all make every day.

***Personal values drive commitment:*** Personal values are the route to loyalty and commitment, not organizational values. Organizational values matter very little until leaders make sure that they help individuals understand their own values and beliefs.

***Say it in your own words:*** Words send signals and hidden assumptions about how someone views the world. You have a responsibility to your constituents to express yourself in an authentic manner.

### Affirm shared values

***Shared values are an organization's promises:*** A leader's promise is really an organization's promise. Shared values are the internal compasses that enable people to act both independently and interdependently.

***Shared values make a difference:*** Organizations with strong values experienced nearly ten times the growth in net income and had three times the growth in stock price compared with nonadaptive cultures.

***Which shared values are important?*** Different values can be effective for different organizations. High-performing organizations don't have to share the same core ideology as long as there is a values-based foundation on which management and leadership practices can be built.

Central themes:

* High-performance standards, commitment to excellence
* Caring attitude about people
* Sense of uniqueness and pride

***Unity is forged, not forced:*** A common understanding of values emerges from a process, not a pronouncement. Leaders can't impose their values on organizational members.
