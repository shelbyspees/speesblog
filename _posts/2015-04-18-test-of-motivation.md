title: Test of Motivation

I was reading [<i class="fa fa-book"></i> *Becoming a Technical Leader*](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B004J4VV3I/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title) and I re-encountered the chapter on keeping a journal.

Weinberg presents this exercise as a test of the reader's motivation to actually become a problem-solving leader. Here's the test:

><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> Starting now, and continuing for three months, spend five minutes each day writing in a personal journal.

Weinberg then gives a dozen or so quotations from people who finally brought themselves to follow his advice and found it helpful.

><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> ...I thought that if I can't do that for three months, perhaps I don't want to be a problem-solving leader after all.

Weinberg points out that if his readers can't commit to five minutes a day of journaling, anything else he suggested would have been "a waste of [his] time."

><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> I recommend the journal as a <em>first</em> step to becoming a technical leader because it is such little commitment that there really is no valid excuse for not doing it.

Weinberg gives several great reasons for keeping a journal:

- review a situation with a fresh mind, free of emotions
- find helpful or unhelpful patterns in your behavior or attitude
- measure your progress
- become comfortable with writing

<aside>Except maybe that last one. I'm probably a bit <em>too</em> comfortable with writing at this point.</aside>

All of these are things I could find beneficial.


<br/>

I've failed this test. On multiple occasions.

My first reaction to five minutes of journaling a day was twofold: 

1. I've been keeping a journal for years and now I write a blog. This whole time my journaling has been more of a distraction than a means for self-improvement. Do I really want to risk wasting more time on pointless introspection?

2. How much could five minutes a day really help? I think I improved more when I started journaling less. Plus I already have my blog.

The first thought assumes all of my introspection has been pointless, and the second ignores the clear examples Weinberg provides to handle exactly that reaction. Even five minutes a day is helpful, and I don't have to let myself get caught up in writing like I used to. I can set a timer. Whatever it takes.

Plus, isn't it sad that I'm making all these excuses not to do something that'll help me? It only takes five minutes a day. I spend more time than that checking Instagram every day. I don't even know those people!

I read all these books on self-improvement but I won't bother to take the tiniest initial baby step to get there. Literally I just need to do it. Then I won't be a failure.

<br/>

I like tests. I like doing well on tests. I think this is a good way to approach getting things done in my life.

Usually when I encounter something hard I think, "Well I could do that if I wanted to, I just don't feel like it." This is true whether it involves learning, my health, or social interactions.

If I make these little actions into a test where I actually fail if I don't complete them (rather than it being ok) then I might have found a way to gamify my self-improvement.

Usually people recommend avoiding black-and-white thinking, but in this case I think I'll find it helpful. It literally just takes five minutes a day. Pass or fail. Do I really want to be a willpower failure?

I've tried gamification of my attempts at self-improvement before. Notable examples include Fitocracy, Todoist, and Beeminder. Beeminder even puts my money on the line but I still find ways to fail. I guess I don't care that much about money.

<aside>So simple, and yet I didn't put it together until now. It's funny how things just hit you after like, forever.</aside>

What do I care about? Passing tests. I can just do it and get it done and then I won't be a failure! That's what it takes for me.

<br/>

Now, while journaling would be helpful for me I think I'm going to design my willpower test using different criteria:

<i class="fa fa-asterisk"></i> **Starting now, and continuing for three months, spend five minutes each day meditating.**

That's it. Meditation isn't that hard. It's just being with yourself for a few minutes. The hard part is you actually have to like being with yourself enough to let go of all the thoughts that show up.

I won't discuss the wide-ranging benefits of meditation here. [<i class="fa fa-book"></i> *The Power of Habit*](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0055PGUYU/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title) and [<i class="fa fa-book"></i> *The Willpower Instinct*](http://www.amazon.com/Willpower-Instinct-Self-Control-Works-Matters-ebook/dp/B005ERIRZE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1423798366&sr=8-1&keywords=the+willpower+instinct) go into plenty of detail on that topic. I'll just say that for my mind and my habits, I'm confident that meditation would do me a lot of good.

Hmm. In writing this post I've convinced myself to follow Weinberg's advice. It's only five minutes a day and since I have a prompt I won't be blabbering about cute guys. This is about me and the version of myself I want to be.
