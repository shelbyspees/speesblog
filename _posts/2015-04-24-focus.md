I'm in that place again. I'm excited about all the things I'm learning, but I'm getting overwhelmed by how much there is to learn.

It's time to prioritize.

Most important is school. I have a ton of reading and lectures to catch up on. I really want to make sure I wrap my head around JavaScript, since I'll probably need it for every job ever, as well as algorithms, since I'll probably need them for every job interview ever.

I've been better about organizing my tasks. It's just a matter of sitting down to do them.

I've been using [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) for a couple years now and I like it a lot. It's the best cross-platform simple to-do list app for solo tasks. I definitely don't use all the functionality but the tagging and project organization work great for me.

		I've tried out a ton of to-do list apps and while I love <a href="https://asana.com/">Asana</a> it's a little overkill for my schoolwork. It'd be a great tool if I happened to be working on a team that didn't use, say, <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues/">GitHub's awesome issues feature</a> though.</p>
	<p>
		<a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> would make a great alternative to <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> with its multimedia support, visual organization, and nested list functionality. Evernote, on the other hand, is better for information hoarders like me who mostly deal in paragraphs.</p>

		No, I'm not getting paid to link to any of these sites. Yes, they should totally hire me to work on their awesome products. <a href="https://twitter.com/speesbag/">Hit me up! <i class="fa fa-twitter"></i> <i class="fa fa-heart"></i></a></p>

I also use [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) (which I pronounce "Zah-pee-ay" thanks to ten years of French in my brain) to send the data from my completed tasks to [this neat Beeminder graph](https://www.beeminder.com/speesbag/goals/schoolwork).

Beeminder is actually a really cool tool, and I'd like to figure out a way to embed their graphs so I can have them immediately visible in my posts here. Like embedded gists, but Beeminder. Can't be that hard, right? Just a bunch of GET calls or something. Yeah.






###Breakable Toys

That brings me back to the topic of this post. I have so many scattered interests when it comes to building my knowledge. The tools I'm currently using are amazing, but I'm beginning to outgrow them.

Evernote sorely lacks support for code, particularly syntax highlighting, so [I've been using GitHub's wiki functionality to organize my notes for my web development class]({{ post.url 2015-04-06-wiki | prepend: site.baseurl }}). GitHub's wikis are great, but it's kind of a pain to have to navigate there from the probably empty repo. I'm sure there are plenty of wiki services out there, but I want to take the advice from ["Breakable Toys" in <i class="fa fa-book"></i> *Apprenticeship Patterns*](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch05.html#breakable_toys) and build my own.

I'm looking at a [tutorial to build one with Rails](http://www.devx.com/webdev/Article/34200?trk=DXRSS_LATEST). I just have to sit down and do it.

Once I do that I can say that I know Rails a bit. And things about web applications in general. That'd be a nice thing to have on my resume.
