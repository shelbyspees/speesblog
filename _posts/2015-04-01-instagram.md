Lately I've been on my phone's Instagram app a lot. 

It's interesting to see what people are up to. A lot of them are people I haven't spoken to since high school.

I guess when I first joined Instagram it pulled the accounts of my Facebook friends and automatically followed them. Last year I deactivated my Facebook because I no longer want to hear about these people, and it's not worth keeping Facebook around for the ten people I do actually talk to.

Because of this, Instagram is my new Facebook.

Millenials are a generation guilty of [crafting our public image](http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/09/why-generation-y-yuppies-are-unhappy.html). Everyone's heard the clich√© about the blooper reel vs. the production edit. Instagram is the airbrushed, Oscar-nominated production edit. Wait, no, it's the advertisement. The best-of everyone's daily mediocrity.

So not only did I go to high school with a bunch of hot rich geniuses, but I also get to see their best-of airbrushed beauty/success on Instagram. And while I do lots of cool stuff too, I'm really bad at remembering to post it.

Why do I still use it then? Because I'm just as guilty as everyone else. I have to craft my public image. I have the same urge to keep up appearances. I'm certainly capable of refraining from comparing myself to the beautiful geniuses I went to high school with, but at a certain level [I crave the shame, the envy](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/06/taming-mammoth-let-peoples-opinions-run-life.html).

Maybe it'll motivate me to get in the gym and actually work on that bikini body. I haven't been happy about a bikini pic since I was 15. 

Wow, that's actually really sad. Nearly 10 years of being ashamed of my body. That's real motivation right there. It's time to end that.
