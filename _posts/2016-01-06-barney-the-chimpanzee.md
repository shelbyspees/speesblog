>Write the story of an anxious chimpanzee who stows away on a ship.

Barney was cold. His fur was wet, matted against his skin. He moved his right leg and the blood rushed back like needles in his veins.

He couldn't see outside the crate, but is that what rotting wood smelled like? Not that he'd know. This was the dirtiest he's been since the day he was born in Philadelphia Greens Veterinary Hospital, known for having the highest quality care in [some region].

Jess wanted Barney free. He more or less understood that. He didn't understand why it was so important to completely uproot his safe, comfortable life, but Jess always knew what was best for him. Barney trusted that he'd be better off once he got settled in to his new home.

Jess had managed to communicate that he'll have to be confined for a while before he gets to enjoy this new life...wherever.

Barney had made sacrifices before. Last year there was a mistake in the feeding schedule that caused Barney to get twice as much food as usual. It took nearly three months for someone to notice the doubled meals.

Chimpanzees are supposed to maintain an appetite to match their energy and nutrient needs. At least, that's what Jess said. Apparently Barney's low-key lifestyle ("inactivity and boredom," Jess called it) suppressed the natural signal that told him when to stop eating. The food was good, it was there, why let it go to waste? he thought.

Unfortunately, Jess ruled that Barney would have to stop eating so much. She organized a rigorous *exercise* routine climbing all over the place. Barney's hands and feet got sore, his arms and legs ached, he was hungry all the time. He was miserable.

Jess kept telling him that this was only temporary, that it was a *sacrifice*. After some arbitrary amount of time Jess decided that Barney had suffered enough. He still had to exercise, but not for nearly as long. He didn't get to eat more food but at least the hunger pangs dissipated.

When Jess performed all those bodily tests she found so important, she said Barney was even healthier than before the meal mix-up. She hugged him and held his hand and said that if he kept up with the *exercise* he'd live extra long.

Barney wasn't sure why she cared so much if he lived an extra five years. His life was good, and he liked being alive, but would he know the difference if he died earlier or later? But Jess was happy and Barney wanted nothing more than to make her happy, so he trusted her.

When Jess told Barney last week that he'd be moving, he trusted her again. She said it would be a sacrifice, like the *exercise*, but he'd be much more comfortable afterward. Barney liked being comfortable. He'd endured a sacrifice before, and it ended, and a year later it didn't seem so bad. So he agreed.

Now he was sorely regretting it.

Barney couldn't get comfortable here. The cold, the wet, the incessant motion made him ache all over. Every day Jess brought him food and every day Barney took one bite and gagged. He felt weak and sick and miserable.

Occasionally Barney would start marching down a road of internal complaints until he'd get dangerously close to resenting Jess. He'd graze the thought: "Why did I trust her? How can she do this to me?" and his heart would ache. Again and again he'd suppress the negativity invading his mind and attempt to clear all his thoughts. Jess was everything to Barney.

This had to be worth it.
