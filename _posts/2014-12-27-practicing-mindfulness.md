Most people think, "My mind is mine." No one else has access. The mind is the most private domain as the center of one's personality.

	<p>These are some notes I took while listening to the audiobook <a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Self-Development/Practicing-Mindfulness-An-Introduction-to-Meditation-Audiobook/B00DDVQQLA"><i class="fa fa-book"></i> Practicing Mindfulness: An Introduction to Meditation.</a></p>
	<p>It's definitely an audiobook I'm going to revisit at some point.</p>

If we lack awareness of how our mind functions, it leads to inattentiveness.

The unoccupied mind wanders to two places:

1. past  
2. future  

The unoccupied mind tends to avoid the present as much as possible. Instead it resorts to assessing and evaluating surroundings and people. 

Mindlessness causes us and others to suffer greatly. It causes us to seek solutions in unhelpful ways:  

* intoxication  
* overwork  
* time-wasting  

The mind is a conditioned phenomenon. It's a consequence of how we've thought and acted up until this point. We need respite from too much thinking. 

The mind is a tool for happiness, not the center of one's personality.
