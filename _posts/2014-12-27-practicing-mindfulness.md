title: Practicing Mindfulness

"My mind is mine." No one else has access. Mind is the most private domain as the center of one's personality.

Little awareness of how our mind functions = inattentiveness.

Unoccupied mind wanders to two places:

1. past  
2. future  

Tends to avoid the present as much as possible. Assessing and evaluating surroundings and people. Mindlessness causes us and others to suffer greatly. Seeks solutions in unhelpful ways:  

* intoxication  
* overwork  
* time-wasting  

Mind is a conditioned phenomenon. Consequence of how we've thought and acted up until this point. Need respite from too much thinking. The mind is a tool for happiness, not the center of one's personality.
