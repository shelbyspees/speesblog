title: Thinking About Summer
category: travel

It's that time of year again. The end of March. That means it's officially summer in the San Fernando Valley.

I've had this same travel itch since [October]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2014-10-27-backpacking %}). I'm dying to be somewhere walkable with good coffee and plazas to chill in all afternoon.

I could fly to Rome in early June after I finish my spring quarter finals, then meet up with Becca and Eva in Deventer and chill there most of the summer. Maybe hit up my friends in Bordeaux and Paris if I can afford it. I'd love to see London and Vienna.

All of this sounds like $$$. Or really €€€. Ouch.

I know I could live out of a suitcase and a backpack for several months. I don't need much besides my laptop and phone and headphones. Sit in cafés and blog and tinker with Github projects. Walk around pretty castles and museums and monuments and take pictures and then blog about them. Get lost and get found and get drunk. But not too drunk.

One thing that was nice about Tokyo was the lockers in every train station. I don't think those exist in most European cities. Most of my valuables can fit on my back at least.

I wonder how minimal I can go.

## Packing list:

### Electronics

- Laptop + case + charger + charger extension
- Extension cord from Japan
- Plug adapters (3)
- Noise-cancelling headphones + case
- In-ear headphones + case
- Tablet
- Phone
- Kindle (probably don't need all of these last three)
- USB wall plug
- Micro-USB cables (2)

I probably don't need my external hard drive since my Dropbox can hold a ton of photos. It's just one more thing to take up space and then lose.

### Clothes

- Underwear (14)
- Tank tops (3)
- T-shirts (2)
- Black thermal (1)
- Cardigan?
- Scarves (3)
- Leggings pants (1 or 2)

- Leggings (2)
- Shorts (2)
- Black leather jacket
- Green military jacket? (unfortunately it totally shows armpit stains)
- Regular bra (1)
- Sports bras (2)
- Warm socks for flights, etc.

I can always buy more shirts, and I'll probably see shirts in Europe that I'll want anyway.

### Shoes

- Brown sandals
- Black sandals
- Toms
- Nike Frees? (in which case I'll need socks)

### Bags and Accessories

- Brown backpack
- Timbuk2 suitcase
- Sunglasses
- Travel wallet
- Daily wallet
- Jewelry + travel jewelry box
- Travel neck pillow?

### Toiletries

Unfortunately these usually take up the most space.

- Deodorant
- Bar soap
- Facial toner
- Facial moisturizers (2)
- Eye cream
- Body moisturizers
- Razors
- Crazy pills (Allegra, etc.)
