title: Biggest Weakness
---

It's taken me a long time to figure this out. I've been doing a lot of introspection over the past year or so and this question always stumped me. But recently I've been struggling with my internal motivation and my willpower. It's a huge mental block for me.

My biggest weakness is that I'm not motivated by my own success. I will bend over backwards to do nice things for people, to put a smile on someone else's face. If someone needs me, I'm there. I'm a team player, I'm positive and cheerful. I'm quick and smart. But I honestly don't want to try to improve myself.

I really don't take care of myself. Diet, exercise, recreation. I'll see friends, but I often neglect them. I don't do things that are really good for me.

That's why I'm seeking an internship. If other people depend on me to learn and improve, I'll do it. I won't want to disappoint. But it'll never happen if I'm sitting here trying to learn everything on my own.

This is why I was so good at teaching. I can feel smart while simultaneously helping someone else reach their goals. It's why I'm good at customer service. It's why I'm never going to be a CEO.

It's why, the moment I have a full-time salary, I'm getting a personal trainer. I don't break appointments. Plus it's nice to have expert guidance, isn't it?

I want a career personal trainer. Someone to walk me through the learning process. Is that asking too much? Am I an entitled millenial? Isn't this what apprenticeships used to be?

Clich√© as it sounds, I live to serve.
