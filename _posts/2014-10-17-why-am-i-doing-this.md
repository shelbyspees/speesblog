title: Why am I doing this?

"I want to get good at this." But why?

I've always liked computers. I'm smart. I should do smart things with computers. There's a talent shortage in the tech industry. We need more women in tech. It makes good money. There are plenty of jobs.

That doesn't motivate me.

What motivates me is helping people. It doesn't have to look like customer service, but somehow knowing that I did something for someone else is so much more satisfying than just doing something for myself. For myself, apparently, I'm only good at intellectualizing. Introspecting. I love verbing adjectives, by the way.

I'm not motivated by my own success. At least, not enough to take an active part in it. What I'm motivated by is a smile on someone's face. A "thank you." "You were great."

This could be tutoring. This could be serving. This could be picking up trash. But I can't help but feel that my potential is wasted in these vocations.
