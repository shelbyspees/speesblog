I've become increasingly obsessed with beauty products over the past two years. When 23-year-old Shelby was introduced to quality moisturizer and eye cream and learned that she didn't have to get wrinkles quite yet, her confidence grew by 200%.

Now I'm reaching a point where I'm spending a lot of money on beauty products and not seeing much of a difference, so I've been sampling moisturizers and other skin care products to figure out what really works for me.
