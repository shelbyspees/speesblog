Wow I've never used the Evernote Android tablet app to write a note before. I could easily use this to write in bed or on a bike at the gym.

So I've been floundering for the past few weeks. Lots of Netflix going on. Very little schoolwork. I was having some anxiety issues and I kept getting stopped every time I thought about the things I wanted to be doing. Thinking about school made me want to throw up.

At the same time I started sleeping a lot. I'd wake up at 7:30 without issue but then end up falling back asleep for several more hours because I'd try to get my reading done wrapped in blankets to keep from freezing to death in my igloo of a bedroom. I'm not ready to waste energy with a space heater at this point.

Lately at the gym I've been hanging out in the sauna. I realized that it's not punishment, it's actually really relaxing except for the dry air. And I realized that if I go to the sauna first thing in the morning, I'll be safe from freezing in my room.

So last night I laid out my gym clothes and this morning I actually woke up at 6:00am, an hour before my alarm.

I let myself curl up in my blankets for an hour, reading twitter before my alarm went off. And then I got up, had some coffee, changed my clothes, and headed out the door.

I wanted to cry. Oh man. I'm a huge wuss in 60F weather.

I was in the sauna by 7:17am. It was perfect. Then I rode the bike for half an hour, got some reading done. I still need to perfect my meal planning but I think this is something I want to be doing from now on.
