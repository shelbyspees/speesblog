title: Learning. Writing.

There's so much to learn.

Should I write about the things I should be learning? Or should I just learn them? I like Jeff Atwood's advice. And [this article](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/you-should-write-blogs).

Yeah the main reason I blog is because I'm a narcissist. Not in the destructive-to-the-people-around-me way. No. I'm just kind of vain. And there's nothing wrong with that (I argue).

I've been writing my thoughts down since 2007. It started with cheap tiny notebooks that I would fill up with the pointless musings of a 16 year old girl. Those I gave to my boyfriend at the time. Like four of them, I think. Four separate notebooks that I'll never get back.

I think those notebooks actually helped me get comfortable with writing. I got so much positive feedback on my writing in college, thanks in part to the hundreds of pages I had filled out in the years prior with stupid, idiotic, pointless thoughts.

The other part was my 11th grade English teacher, Firestein. Somehow I passed the AP exam despite skipping one of the essays and breaking down in tears. Yeah, I cried a lot in that class. Less so in 12th grade English. That's when I started dumbing down my speech on purpose to make it easier to participate. I wonder if anyone noticed.

So many lovely habits that got developed during those foundational years.

This is my fourth blog that I've started. I deleted the first three. The first was the Blogger assignment for Japanese 6, a blog I kept open to record my experiences in France. That didn't happen. I still have the notebook from France though. Pathetic.

The second was Tumblr, I guess. I'm not sure if I used Wordpress or Tumblr first. My Wordpress blog lasted a while though. I wouldn't exactly call Tumblr a blog, anyway. More like a content/comment aggregator.

<s>This blog is my favorite so far. I like being able to make new posts from Evernote, and format using Markdown. It's so simple and effortless. Postach.io should be thanking me for how much I recommend it to my friends. Thanking me monetarily.</s>

<i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></i> Update: Recently migrated to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). It's great.

This blog really is just a place for my thoughts. I don't pretend that anyone will ever read it.
