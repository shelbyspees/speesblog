This question comes up a lot so I decided to post an answer I wrote down recently. I may update this in the future.

## Why do you like to code/program?

Software combines so many things I find interesting. It's design, it's analysis, it's piecing together parts to make something new. It's in the big picture, it's in the details. I can dream and I can nitpick. I can create something new and useful out of almost literally nothing.

Any other field of engineering requires expensive materials and tools to create anything at all. Software is basically free to create, and you can build in any direction you want (low-level, high-level, sideways).

Coming from a linguistics background, programming scratches a lot of my intellectual itches. I like to analyze and nitpick, but I also like to describe and understand things how they are. If you learn a foreign language well enough you gain an intuitive sense of how things are supposed to be; we have this in programming languages as well (what makes something Pythonic for example).

I also love understanding systems, and that's probably why I like grammar so much. Actually there are things about programming that I like better than learning foreign languages. When you're in the middle of a conversation and you forget how to say the word you want to say, you're screwed. When writing a program you don't have to remember what everything is called, you just need to understand how they piece together. As someone who easily forgets vocabulary this saves me a lot of headaches.
