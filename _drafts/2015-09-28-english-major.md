Lately I've been on a learning spree. Nonfiction advice writing has kind of worn itself out though. It doesn't seem that there's much left to learn from the self-improvement genre at this point. I'll only improve by applying those lessons.

So I turned to fiction, as I mentioned in an [earlier post](). I started with [Stephen King's *On Writing*](), went through [Sol Stein's *Stein on Writing*](), and now I'm in the middle of [The Great Courses' *Writing Great Fiction: Storytelling Tips and Techniques*](). Highly recommend all three of these audiobooks for anyone who likes reading fiction and has an interest in English language style and usage. Even as a reader they were enlightening.

The Great Courses lecture series on *Writing Great Fiction* is presented by novelist James Hynes, who has also worked as a writing professor. Hynes gives quite a few reading recommendations (and spoils quite a few books in his lectures) and after hearing his analysis I decided to try reading these books and looking for the details he described.
  
One thing is certain, I'm a much better reader now that I was in 11th grade English class. I think now I'm trying to undo the torment I put myself through in my attempt to succeed in that class.
  
AP English Lang was great for me. It was one of the catalysts that pushed me onto the path of becoming a decent academic writer. I also ruthlessly compared myself to my classmates. I won't go into detail about my teenage angst but basically I cried a lot that year.

So I hated English classes, I hated analyzing literature. I just wanted to read it.

It wasn't until my delicate disposition was insulted and assaulted by some really terrible fiction writing earlier this year---by someone who considers themselves a professional---that I realized I can do a lot better.

This is all old news. What I want to write about now is my reading list.
