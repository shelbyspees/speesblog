I'd like to try answering this question from Chapter 16 of [<i class="fa fa-book"></i> *Becoming a Technical Leader*](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B004J4VV3I/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title):

>What messages do you give yourself when you fail at something? What rules are behind those messages?

I guess I tell myself that it's ok, it's not a big deal. I think I have two rules that cause me to respond this way:

1. My parents always told me it was ok to quit doing something if I didn't like it. They didn't want to pressure me into perfect grades or athletics like some parents do.

2. I know I'm going to die one day. I never felt like I'd live a long time.
