# Advice on Picking a Man to Marry<br><small>From a gay woman who was divorced by age 30.</small>

Ladies: never lower your standards for a partner. Ever. You bring more value to a relationship than 99% of men, no matter how rich he is.

Men in het marriages benefit MUCH more from that arrangement than women do, & always have. It's a racket. Beware before you play yourself.

Women are taught to 1) get edu; 2) work outside home; 3) do full caretaking of man/kids; 4) stay hot. Don't underestimate your worth.

I beg you to consider the return on YOUR investment if you saddle yourself with a husband. Be judicious. Marriage = huge liability.

The social pressure of being a "good wife" in a hetero marriage is no joke. It'll have you compromising your principles in no time. DON'T.

Everyone will support a husband who complains about his wife not doing enough. CONSTANTLY. No matter what he's doing. I've experienced it.

The whole culture supports men in devaluing their wives' labor in childbearing, caretaking, social relationship maintenance, and paid work.

You know it's true. You've seen husbands whose wives work and keep a beautiful home complain that she serves dinner at 6:30 instead of 5.

Use your brain with this, too. Watch how he lives his life. They'll lie to you and say they get it but they DON'T.

Remember as a woman your work is so devalued YOU have been trained not to see it as work. Mother's day cards to MIL. Planning a wedding.

> "Going back to this, I wish I'd had these lectures/lessons (& been wise enough to heed them) when I was planning the wedding of my ex-husband's dreams. It never ceased to amaze me how somehow I got roped into planning what he wanted & I didn't. Now I know how."

I wanted to elope! But somehow the wedding was my doing!

In fact, men will COMPLAIN about the work you're doing. Talk on the phone too much. Always want to go out. Aka "maintaining relationships".

Husband gets to complain that you always want to talk meanwhile you're doing ALL of the emotional work being his sounding board & support.

> "And once you see it IS work, it can be basically impossible to convince anyone else it is. Esp if there's any hint you enjoy it."
