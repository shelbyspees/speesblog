I have 42,222 comment karma on my Reddit account right now. I joined back in June of 2010 and I've kept the same account this whole time. This is my first time sharing my comment history publicly.

For a long time I was paranoid about my honest comments getting out. I think my twitter history is much more vulgar, to be honest. If it comes down to it, I delete my accounts.

Sure, you'd probably be able to find my history with the [Wayback Machine]() or some other data cache, but if discussing adult topics in my free time is enough to scare potential employers, I probably don't want to work for them.
