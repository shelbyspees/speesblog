I have 42,222 comment karma on my Reddit account right now. I joined back in June of 2010 and I've kept the same account this whole time. This is my first time sharing my comment history in public.

For a long time I was paranoid about my honest comments getting out. I think my twitter history is much more vulgar, to be honest. If it comes down to it, I delete my accounts.

Future employers might find my online history with the [Wayback Machine](). I'm not sure I care. Discussing adult topics in my free time shouldn't be enough to scare potential employers. If it is, I'm not sure I want to work for them.
