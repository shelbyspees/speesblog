I almost did it again today.

I've been actively self-destructing for the past monthish. I was self-destructing a lot in the fall, then I cooled down a bit, and since the end of January I've been back at it.

I'm so sick of school. I almost withdrew for the quarter today. That would be the third time. I considered withdrawing from the university and just not finishing my degree. It's not that it's too hard. I love the subject matter. But I can't finish shit. I don't finish shit. I don't want to. It's all so pointless.

Damn typing on this thing is so satisfying. I'm so glad I can type quickly now. Holy shit it feels amazing.

I just want to be able to do something with all these hours every day instead of my life passing me by in a blur.
