I'm in that place again. I'm excited about all the things I'm learning, but I'm getting overwhelmed by how much there is to learn.

It's time to prioritize.

Most important is school. I have a ton of reading and lectures to catch up on. I really want to make sure I wrap my head around JavaScript, since I'll probably need it for every job ever, as well as algorithms, since I'll probably need it for every job interview ever.

I've been better about organizing my tasks. It's just a matter of sitting down to do them.
