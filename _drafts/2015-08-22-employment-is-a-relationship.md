##In progress.

You spend half of your waking life at work if you're working full-time. Let's not forget that.

I often see this sentiment that you shouldn't make friends with your coworkers. You shouldn't trust your company to take care of you. And to be honest, having experienced what it's like to work for a business that doesn't trust me, I don't blame them.

But if you'd humor me by sustaining your disbelief for a second, I'd like to talk about what's possible.

Some people get lucky in their career. They find work that's endlessly fulfilling. They find a manager who wants what's best for them. They work for a company that clearly values their skills and input.

Most of us don't get so lucky. We work jobs that are [don't need to exist](http://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/) doing work that's [beneath our abilities](https://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2014/05/26/why-corporate-conformity-doesnt-work/):

>Abstractly, most white-collar workers think (or, I would argue, know) that they’re good for what they’re asked to do. When they go into an office and see others suffering just as much as they are, it’s much harder to hold that view, because (although I disagree with this reasoning) it equates the thought, “I am too good for this job”, with “I am better than him, that guy doing an equivalently crappy job”. Some people think that way about those they sit next to on a daily basis, but most people don’t like thinking that way. Hence, cognitive dissonance sets in. <mark>If people become used to the sight of highly qualified people in humiliating, subordinate roles doing menial work, they’re likely to accept that situation for themselves.</mark>
