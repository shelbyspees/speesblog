What is a career? Why do we care about the title, the office, the work? At the end of the day, it's about a lot more than the paycheck.

You spend half of your waking life at work if you're working full-time. Let's not forget that.

I often see this sentiment that you shouldn't make friends with your coworkers. You shouldn't trust your company to take care of you. And to be honest, having experienced what it's like to work for a business that doesn't trust me, I don't blame them.

But if you'd humor me by sustaining your disbelief for a second, I'd like to talk about what's possible.

Some people get lucky in their career. They find work that's endlessly fulfilling. They find a manager who wants what's best for them. They work for a company that clearly values their skills and input.

Most of us don't get so lucky. We work jobs that [don't need to exist](http://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/) doing work that's [beneath our abilities](https://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2014/05/26/why-corporate-conformity-doesnt-work/):

>Abstractly, most white-collar workers think (or, I would argue, know) that they’re good for what they’re asked to do. When they go into an office and see others suffering just as much as they are, it’s much harder to hold that view, because (although I disagree with this reasoning) it equates the thought, “I am too good for this job”, with “I am better than him, that guy doing an equivalently crappy job”. Some people think that way about those they sit next to on a daily basis, but most people don’t like thinking that way. Hence, cognitive dissonance sets in. <mark>If people become used to the sight of highly qualified people in humiliating, subordinate roles doing menial work, they’re likely to accept that situation for themselves.</mark>

(Unfortunately?) many white collar jobs are redundant, unnecessary layers of bureaucracy. These jobs appeared after the industrial revolution and before the information age, and the US experienced an unprecedented era of prosperity. For the first time, those without specialized, professional skills could find work that didn't require getting their hands dirty.

These paper-pushing jobs have been automated in waves since the 1960s. Humans aren't good at this repetitive, number crunching work anyway. Humans are good at human work.

Look at the most popular university majors: psychology, communications, sociology, political science. The majority of educated people are interested in *people*. Don't make them take jobs filling out pointless paperwork ad nauseum.

The professionals--doctors, lawyers, architects, engineers--are here to stay. My theory is the people work is here to stay as well. We need HR, managers, receptionists, customer service reps. I should be able to call my bank or ISP and immediately talk to a human. There are lots of things computers are much better at, but communication isn't one of them.

With the disappearance of these paper-pushing jobs we're starting to see a gaping hole in the economy. We have all these middle-class college-bound kids but not enough white collar jobs to support them. How are they going to be able to afford their two-story suburban houses this way?

Lately you see recommendations for un(der)employed young people to consider blue collar work.

Types of blue collar work:

- unskilled manual labor (digging ditches)
- semi-skilled manual labor (assembly, maintenance, repair of machinery)
- highly-skilled craftsmanship (building custom furniture)

Even within blue collar work you see class divides. How does a person even learn a craft well enough to be able to support themselves on income from selling their work? We take for granted that writing, art, and music are fields that require extreme hustle.
