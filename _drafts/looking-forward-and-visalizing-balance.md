Now that things are going well for me, I have to be careful not to bite off more than I can chew.

Somehow I manage to do that every year in the fall. I think it's something about having a September birthday. I think, *I'm this age now so I should be able to handle it.* But I can't. I always drop the ball somewhere.

In my post on visualizing normal, I mentioned how I can only get up early when I think about doing it for several days before. I can only cook a decent dinner when I imagine myself doing it the whole day. I can only give a good, natural presentation when I've mentally laughed off all the mistakes I might make.

Now I'm more aware of my need and ability to do this. I'm also doing better because of my medication. I've always been big on planning, but for the first time in ages I feel confident about 

## Future self

[Tim Pychyl]() of the [iProcrastinate Podcast]() asserts that those who procrastinate have a poor relationship with their future selves. This has absolutely been true for me.

It seems this poor future relationship is common among people who experience a lot of mental, emotional, financial, or physical instability (see [poverty brain]() as one important example). Having experienced all four at different points in my life--sometimes simultaneously--I know that trying to delay gratification amid such instability can feel like torture.

This brings up a huge point about intersectionality: people who are underprivileged in one or more areas have a harder time delaying gratification than "normal" people (people with privilege). People in poverty are more likely to be overweight and have health problems (here's one [citation]()).

When you have the triple burden of poverty, obesity, and health problems, short-term gratification is the only kind of gratification you get. It's common to hear criticism of poor people for buying iPhones and Xboxes, but should a poor person have to live like the Amish to get societal approval? Give them a fucking break.

This is why I'll one again push for "lazy" to be considered an ableist slur. This is why we don't blame the poor for their problems, just like we don't blame alcoholics or addicts for their disease. I'm a socialist, ok? As a society we should be making things better, easier, more accessible for all human beings.

Many people (in my experience, usually upper-middle class white men) will still blame and deride someone for being fat. It's as if they've never encountered the [reams of research]() showing that shame and criticism don't help people lose weight.

People much more knowledgeable about the intersection of socioeconomic, ethnoracial, health, and other disadvantages (and corresponding privileges) can do this amazingly complex subject much more justice than I can here in my weak blog post. But you should know that it's important and all these things interact with each other.

Tim Pychyl explains that people who procrastinate have a warped view of their future self. They think their future self will be much more capable at accomplishing the task at hand than their present self.
