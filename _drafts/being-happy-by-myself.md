In my "Sushi Date" post I mentioned that I was feeling a bit lonely:

> To be honest, I was going through a dating funk the past few weeks that Iâ€™m really only now recovering from. I needed attention. Male attention. I wanted a boyfriend, dammit. I was a little desperate. Just a tad.


## History lesson

So, I've always been boy-crazy. I wanted boyfriends as early as preschool, and all through elementary school, middle school, high school, college, and in adulthood. I never chilled out or got over it. When the dating pool sucked, I altered my expectations (aka lowered my standards).

It's so pervasive that I feel like I'm missing something if I don't have a crush at the moment.

What's funny is that I knew my boy-craziness was *very* different starting in about high school. When I compared my thoughts to Becca's and Lisa's, I thought they were aliens and they thought I was legitimately insane.

## Contentment

Things have changed a lot for me in the past month. I'm still tired of being lonely

One thing I wish was possible was for me to work 80 hours a week and never feel lonely. As magical as my meds are, I can't work 80 hours a week without burning out.
