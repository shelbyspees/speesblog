In my [Sushi Date](/personal/2016/05/25/sushi-date/) post I mentioned that I was feeling a bit lonely:

> To be honest, I was going through a dating funk the past few weeks that I’m really only now recovering from. I needed attention. Male attention. I wanted a boyfriend, dammit. I was a little desperate. Just a tad.

Since then I've felt significantly less desperate. Part of it is being scared straight from that sushi date episode, but most of it is from the benefits of ADHD treatment.

## Sex-related ADHD symptoms

ADHD symptoms usually include some sex-related problems, but these problems are usually limited to inattention and need for novelty:

> I’ve found that two of the most common sexual problems associated with ADHD are of the orgasm phase: Delayed Ejaculation and Female Orgasmic Disorder. It stands to reason that if one has difficulty concentrating during sexual activity, it will be that much harder to achieve an appropriate level of stimulation to reach orgasm.

> ### Hypersexuality and ADHD
>
> Hypersexuality means you have an unusually high sex drive.
>
> Sexual stimulation releases endorphins and mobilizes the brain’s neurotransmitters. This gives a feeling of calmness that reduces the restlessness often caused by ADHD. However, promiscuity and consumption of pornography can be sources of relationship strife.
>
> Some people with ADHD may engage in risky sexual practices due to problems with impulsivity. People with ADHD may also be at increased risk for substance use disorders, which may further impair decision-making and result in sexual risk-taking.

> The most innervated parts of the body are the mouth, lips, tongue, fingers and genitalia. Hence adolescents and adults with ADHD often masturbate a lot. The stimulation is extraordinarily calming for them and climax release a flood of Dopamine in the pleasure center of the brain. Promiscuity, hyper-sexuality and "sex addiction" often ensue.

## History lesson

So, I've always been boy-crazy. I wanted boyfriends as early as preschool, and all through elementary school, middle school, high school, college, and in adulthood. I never chilled out or got over it. When the dating pool sucked, I altered my expectations (aka lowered my standards).

It's so pervasive that I feel like I'm missing something if I don't have a crush at the moment.

What's funny is that I knew my boy-craziness was *very* different starting in about high school. When I compared my thoughts to Becca's and Lisa's, I thought they were aliens and they thought I was legitimately insane.

During my freshman year of college, I sought out counseling through Student Health about my boy-craziness. At my appointment, I explained to the male counselor that I got way too excited about guys. I basically just gushed at him about cute boys for probably 20 minutes. He dismissed my concerns, told me I was fine, gave me a list of outside counselors to see if it started to interfere with my 

Actually now that I think about it, I'd probably be so much better off today if I'd gone to see one of those counselors. But scheduling *therapy* appointments over the phone with strangers and then going to strange places in Santa Barbara for *therapy* was too much for my nervous 18 year old brain to handle.

Mental health professionals who refer you should really offer to help you schedule these appointments, or at least have a nurse or administrative staff help you. 

This was still a problem when I sought counseling on my own in 2014 when I was re-diagnosed with depression. If you have severe depression, anxiety, or other debilitating mental health problems, scheduling those first appointments is

When I started taking ADHD medication I noticed an immediate drop in my boy-craziness. It makes sense, since boy-craziness is one possible result when you combine impulsiveness, distractibility, and hyperfocus.
