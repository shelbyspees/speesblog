title: ADHD and Dating

In my [Sushi Date](/personal/2016/05/25/sushi-date/) post I mentioned that I was feeling a bit lonely:

> To be honest, I was going through a dating funk the past few weeks that I’m only now recovering from. I needed attention. Male attention. I wanted a boyfriend, dammit. I was a little desperate. Just a tad.

Since then I've felt less desperate. I got scared straight from that sushi date episode, but I think I also benefitted from my ADHD treatment.

## Sex-related ADHD symptoms

ADHD symptoms usually include some sex-related problems. The list of such problems is tends to be limited to two symptoms: inattention and need for novelty.

> I’ve found that two of the most common sexual problems associated with ADHD are of the orgasm phase: Delayed Ejaculation and Female Orgasmic Disorder. It stands to reason that if one has difficulty concentrating during sexual activity, it will be that much harder to achieve an appropriate level of stimulation to reach orgasm.

> ### Hypersexuality and ADHD
>
> Hypersexuality means you have an unusually high sex drive.
>
> Sexual stimulation releases endorphins and mobilizes the brain’s neurotransmitters. This gives a feeling of calmness that reduces the restlessness often caused by ADHD. However, promiscuity and consumption of pornography can be sources of relationship strife.
>
> Some people with ADHD may engage in risky sexual practices due to problems with impulsivity. People with ADHD may also be at increased risk for substance use disorders, which may further impair decision-making and result in sexual risk-taking.

> The most innervated parts of the body are the mouth, lips, tongue, fingers and genitalia. Hence adolescents and adults with ADHD often masturbate a lot. The stimulation is extraordinarily calming for them and climax release a flood of Dopamine in the pleasure center of the brain. Promiscuity, hyper-sexuality and "sex addiction" often ensue.

## History lesson

So, I've always been boy-crazy. I wanted boyfriends as early as preschool. Also throughout elementary school, middle school, high school, college, and in adulthood. I never chilled out or got over it. When the dating pool sucked, I altered my expectations (aka lowered my standards).

It's so pervasive that I feel like I'm missing something if I don't have a crush at the moment.

I realized my boy-craziness was different starting in about high school. When I compared my thoughts to Becca's and Lisa's, I thought they were aliens. They thought I was insane.

I sought out counseling through Student Health my freshman year of college. At my appointment, I asked about my boy-craziness. I explained to the male counselor that I got way too excited about guys. I kind of just gushed at him about cute boys for 20 minutes.

The counselor dismissed my concerns and told me I was fine. He gave me a list of outside counselors to see if I became depressed or something.

Actually now that I think about it, I'd be so much better off today if I'd gone to see one of those counselors. 

But at the time scheduling appointments over the phone was my worst nightmare. On stop of that, going to strange places in Santa Barbara and asking for *therapy* was terrifying. The prospect was too much for my nervous 18 year old brain to handle.

<aside>There should be accomodations when mental health professionals refer those with mental illness. The referring doctor could help schedule these appointments. If not, at least have a nurse or another staff member do it.</aside>

This was still a problem when I sought counseling on my own in 2014 when I was re-diagnosed with depression. If you have severe debilitating mental health problems, scheduling those first appointments is terrifying.

## Back to the present

In my post [ADHD treatment makes me no longer hate myself](/mental_health/2016/06/24/adhd-treatment/) I 

When I started taking ADHD medication I noticed an immediate drop in my boy-craziness. It makes sense. Think about when you combine impulsiveness, distractibility, and hyperfocus. Boy-craziness is one possible result.
